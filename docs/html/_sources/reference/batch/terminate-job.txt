Synopsis

    terminate-job
  --job-id <value>

Options
=======

``--job-id`` (string)


  The AWS Batch job ID of the job to terminate.

  

``--reason`` (string)


  A message to attach to the job that explains the reason for canceling it. This message is returned by future  DescribeJobs operations on the job. This message is also recorded in the AWS Batch activity logs. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
