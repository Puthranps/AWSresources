    update-compute-environment
  --compute-environment <value>

=======
Options
=======

``--compute-environment`` (string)


  The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment to update.

  

``--state`` (string)


  The state of the compute environment. Compute environments in the ``ENABLED`` state can accept jobs from a queue and scale in or out automatically based on the workload demand of its associated queues.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``ENABLED``

  
  *   ``DISABLED``

  

  

``--compute-resources`` (structure)


  Details of the compute resources managed by the compute environment. Required for a managed compute environment.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    minvCpus=integer,maxvCpus=integer,desiredvCpus=integer




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "minvCpus": integer,
    "maxvCpus": integer,
    "desiredvCpus": integer
  }



``--service-role`` (string)


  The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows AWS Batch to make calls to other AWS services on your behalf.

   

  If your specified role has a path other than ``/`` , then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.

   

  .. note::

     

    Depending on how you created your AWS Batch service role, its ARN may contain the ``service-role`` path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, AWS Batch assumes that your ARN does not use the ``service-role`` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.

     

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

========
Examples
========

**To update a compute environment**

This example disables the `P2OnDemand` compute environment so it can be deleted.

Command::

  aws batch update-compute-environment --compute-environment P2OnDemand --state DISABLED

Output::

	{
	    "computeEnvironmentName": "P2OnDemand",
	    "computeEnvironmentArn": "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:012345678910:compute-environment/P2OnDemand"
	}


======
Output
======

computeEnvironmentName -> (string)

  

  The name of compute environment.

  

  

computeEnvironmentArn -> (string)

  

  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment.
