Options

``--next-marker`` (string)


  If you specify a value for ``Limit`` and you have more ``RuleGroups`` than the value of ``Limit`` , AWS WAF returns a ``NextMarker`` value in the response that allows you to list another group of ``RuleGroups`` . For the second and subsequent ``ListRuleGroups`` requests, specify the value of ``NextMarker`` from the previous response to get information about another batch of ``RuleGroups`` .

  

``--limit`` (integer)


  Specifies the number of ``RuleGroups`` that you want AWS WAF to return for this request. If you have more ``RuleGroups`` than the number that you specify for ``Limit`` , the response includes a ``NextMarker`` value that you can use to get another batch of ``RuleGroups`` .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Output
======

NextMarker -> (string)

  

  If you have more ``RuleGroups`` than the number that you specified for ``Limit`` in the request, the response includes a ``NextMarker`` value. To list more ``RuleGroups`` , submit another ``ListRuleGroups`` request, and specify the ``NextMarker`` value from the response in the ``NextMarker`` value in the next request.

  

  

RuleGroups -> (list)

  

  An array of  RuleGroup objects.

  

  (structure)

    

    Contains the identifier and the friendly name or description of the ``RuleGroup`` .

    

    RuleGroupId -> (string)

      

      A unique identifier for a ``RuleGroup`` . You use ``RuleGroupId`` to get more information about a ``RuleGroup`` (see  GetRuleGroup ), update a ``RuleGroup`` (see  UpdateRuleGroup ), insert a ``RuleGroup`` into a ``WebACL`` or delete one from a ``WebACL`` (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a ``RuleGroup`` from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRuleGroup ).

       

       ``RuleGroupId`` is returned by  CreateRuleGroup and by  ListRuleGroups .

      

      

    Name -> (string)

      

      A friendly name or description of the  RuleGroup . You can't change the name of a ``RuleGroup`` after you create it.
