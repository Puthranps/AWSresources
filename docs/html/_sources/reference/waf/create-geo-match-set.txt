create-geo-match-set
********************



===========
Description
===========



Creates an  GeoMatchSet , which you use to specify which web requests you want to allow or block based on the country that the requests originate from. For example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from one or more countries and you want to block the requests, you can create an ``GeoMatchSet`` that contains those countries and then configure AWS WAF to block the requests. 

 

To create and configure a ``GeoMatchSet`` , perform the following steps:

 

 
* Use  GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ``ChangeToken`` parameter of a ``CreateGeoMatchSet`` request. 
 
* Submit a ``CreateGeoMatchSet`` request. 
 
* Use ``GetChangeToken`` to get the change token that you provide in the ``ChangeToken`` parameter of an  UpdateGeoMatchSet request. 
 
* Submit an ``UpdateGeoMatchSetSet`` request to specify the countries that you want AWS WAF to watch for. 
 

 

For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the `AWS WAF Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/>`__ .

Synopsis

::

    create-geo-match-set
  --name <value>
  --change-token <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--name`` (string)


  A friendly name or description of the  GeoMatchSet . You can't change ``Name`` after you create the ``GeoMatchSet`` .

  

``--change-token`` (string)


  The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Output
======

GeoMatchSet -> (structure)

  

  The  GeoMatchSet returned in the ``CreateGeoMatchSet`` response. The ``GeoMatchSet`` contains no ``GeoMatchConstraints`` .

  

  GeoMatchSetId -> (string)

    

    The ``GeoMatchSetId`` for an ``GeoMatchSet`` . You use ``GeoMatchSetId`` to get information about a ``GeoMatchSet`` (see  GeoMatchSet ), update a ``GeoMatchSet`` (see  UpdateGeoMatchSet ), insert a ``GeoMatchSet`` into a ``Rule`` or delete one from a ``Rule`` (see  UpdateRule ), and delete a ``GeoMatchSet`` from AWS WAF (see  DeleteGeoMatchSet ).

     

     ``GeoMatchSetId`` is returned by  CreateGeoMatchSet and by  ListGeoMatchSets .

    

    

  Name -> (string)

    

    A friendly name or description of the  GeoMatchSet . You can't change the name of an ``GeoMatchSet`` after you create it.

    

    

  GeoMatchConstraints -> (list)

    

    An array of  GeoMatchConstraint objects, which contain the country that you want AWS WAF to search for.

    

    (structure)

      

      The country from which web requests originate that you want AWS WAF to search for.

      

      Type -> (string)

        

        The type of geographical area you want AWS WAF to search for. Currently ``Country`` is the only valid value.

        

        

      Value -> (string)

        

        The country that you want AWS WAF to search for.

        

        

      

    

  

ChangeToken -> (string)

  

  The ``ChangeToken`` that you used to submit the ``CreateGeoMatchSet`` request. You can also use this value to query the status of the request. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
