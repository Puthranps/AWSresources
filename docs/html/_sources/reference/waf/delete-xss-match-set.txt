********************
delete-xss-match-set
********************



===========
Description
===========



Permanently deletes an  XssMatchSet . You can't delete an ``XssMatchSet`` if it's still used in any ``Rules`` or if it still contains any  XssMatchTuple objects.

 

If you just want to remove an ``XssMatchSet`` from a ``Rule`` , use  UpdateRule .

 

To permanently delete an ``XssMatchSet`` from AWS WAF, perform the following steps:

 

 
* Update the ``XssMatchSet`` to remove filters, if any. For more information, see  UpdateXssMatchSet . 
 
* Use  GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ``ChangeToken`` parameter of a ``DeleteXssMatchSet`` request. 
 
* Submit a ``DeleteXssMatchSet`` request.

Options

``--xss-match-set-id`` (string)


  The ``XssMatchSetId`` of the  XssMatchSet that you want to delete. ``XssMatchSetId`` is returned by  CreateXssMatchSet and by  ListXssMatchSets .

  

``--change-token`` (string)


  The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
