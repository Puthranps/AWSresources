``--geo-match-set-id`` (string)


  The ``GeoMatchSetId`` of the  GeoMatchSet that you want to get. ``GeoMatchSetId`` is returned by  CreateGeoMatchSet and by  ListGeoMatchSets .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

GeoMatchSet -> (structure)

  

  Information about the  GeoMatchSet that you specified in the ``GetGeoMatchSet`` request. This includes the ``Type`` , which for a ``GeoMatchContraint`` is always ``Country`` , as well as the ``Value`` , which is the identifier for a specific country.

  

  GeoMatchSetId -> (string)

    

    The ``GeoMatchSetId`` for an ``GeoMatchSet`` .
