***************************



===========
Description
===========



The ``ListQualificationRequests`` operation retrieves requests for Qualifications of a particular Qualification type. The owner of the Qualification type calls this operation to poll for pending requests, and accepts them using the AcceptQualification operation. 



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/mturk-requester-2017-01-17/ListQualificationRequests>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``list-qualification-requests`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``QualificationRequests``

=======
Options
=======

``--qualification-type-id`` (string)


  The ID of the QualificationType.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

NumResults -> (integer)

  

  The number of Qualification requests on this page in the filtered results list, equivalent to the number of Qualification requests being returned by this call.

  

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more data to retrieve), Amazon Mechanical Turk returns a pagination token in the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set of results. 

  

  

QualificationRequests -> (list)

  

  The Qualification request. The response includes one QualificationRequest element for each Qualification request returned by the query.

  

  (structure)

    

    The QualificationRequest data structure represents a request a Worker has made for a Qualification. 

    

    QualificationRequestId -> (string)

      

      The ID of the Qualification request, a unique identifier generated when the request was submitted. 

      

      

    QualificationTypeId -> (string)

      

      The ID of the Qualification type the Worker is requesting, as returned by the CreateQualificationType operation. 

      

      

    WorkerId -> (string)

      

      The ID of the Worker requesting the Qualification.

      

      

    Test -> (string)

      

      The contents of the Qualification test that was presented to the Worker, if the type has a test and the Worker has submitted answers. This value is identical to the QuestionForm associated with the Qualification type at the time the Worker requests the Qualification.

      

      

    Answer -> (string)

      

      The Worker's answers for the Qualification type's test contained in a QuestionFormAnswers document, if the type has a test and the Worker has submitted answers. If the Worker does not provide any answers, Answer may be empty. 

      

      

    SubmitTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time the Qualification request had a status of Submitted. This is either the time the Worker submitted answers for a Qualification test, or the time the Worker requested the Qualification if the Qualification type does not have a test.
