===========
Description
===========



Cancels a pending step or steps in a running cluster. Available only in Amazon EMR versions 4.8.0 and later, excluding version 5.0.0. A maximum of 256 steps are allowed in each CancelSteps request. CancelSteps is idempotent but asynchronous; it does not guarantee a step will be canceled, even if the request is successfully submitted. You can only cancel steps that are in a ``PENDING`` state.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
