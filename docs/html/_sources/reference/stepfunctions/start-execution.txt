Options

``--state-machine-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine to execute.

  

``--name`` (string)


  The name of the execution. This name must be unique for your AWS account and region for 90 days. For more information, see `Limits Related to State Machine Executions <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/limits.html#service-limits-state-machine-executions>`__ in the *AWS Step Functions Developer Guide* .

   

  .. warning::

     

    An execution can't use the name of another execution for 90 days.

     

    When you make multiple ``StartExecution`` calls with the same name, the new execution doesn't run and the following rules apply:

     

     
    * When the original execution is open and the execution input from the new call is *different* , the ``ExecutionAlreadyExists`` message is returned. 
     
    * When the original execution is open and the execution input from the new call is *identical* , the ``Success`` message is returned. 
     
    * When the original execution is closed, the ``ExecutionAlreadyExists`` message is returned regardless of input. 
     

     

   

  A name must *not* contain:

   

   
  * whitespace 
   
  * brackets ``< > { } [ ]``   
   
  * wildcard characters ``? *``   
   
  * special characters ``" # % \ ^ | ~ ` $ & , ; : /``   
   
  * control characters (``U+0000-001F`` , ``U+007F-009F`` ) 
   

  

``--input`` (string)


  The string that contains the JSON input data for the execution, for example:

   

   ``"input": "{\"first_name\" : \"test\"}"``  

   

  .. note::

     

    If you don't include any JSON input data, you still must include the two braces, for example: ``"input": "{}"``  

     

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
