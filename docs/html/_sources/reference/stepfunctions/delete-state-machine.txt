===========
Description
===========



Deletes a state machine. This is an asynchronous operation: It sets the state machine's status to ``DELETING`` and begins the deletion process. Each state machine execution is deleted the next time it makes a state transition.

 

.. note::

   

  The state machine itself is deleted after all executions are completed or deleted.

``--state-machine-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine to delete.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
