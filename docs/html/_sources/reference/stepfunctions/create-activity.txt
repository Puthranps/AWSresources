===========
Description
===========



Creates an activity. An activity is a task which you write in any programming language and host on any machine which has access to AWS Step Functions. Activities must poll Step Functions using the ``GetActivityTask`` API action and respond using ``SendTask*`` API actions. This function lets Step Functions know the existence of your activity and returns an identifier for use in a state machine and when polling from the activity.

Options

``--name`` (string)


  The name of the activity to create. This name must be unique for your AWS account and region for 90 days. For more information, see `Limits Related to State Machine Executions <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/limits.html#service-limits-state-machine-executions>`__ in the *AWS Step Functions Developer Guide* .

   

  A name must *not* contain:

   

   
  * whitespace 
   
  * brackets ``< > { } [ ]``   
   
  * wildcard characters ``? *``   
   
  * special characters ``" # % \ ^ | ~ ` $ & , ; : /``   
   
  * control characters (``U+0000-001F`` , ``U+007F-009F`` ) 
   

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
