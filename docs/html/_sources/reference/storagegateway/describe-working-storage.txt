===========
Description
===========



Returns information about the working storage of a gateway. This operation is only supported in the stored volumes gateway type. This operation is deprecated in cached volumes API version (20120630). Use DescribeUploadBuffer instead.

 

.. note::

   

  Working storage is also referred to as upload buffer. You can also use the DescribeUploadBuffer operation to add upload buffer to a stored volume gateway.

   

 

The response includes disk IDs that are configured as working storage, and it includes the amount of working storage allocated and used.

Options

``--gateway-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways operation to return a list of gateways for your account and region.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output
======

GatewayARN -> (string)

  

  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways operation to return a list of gateways for your account and region.

  

  

DiskIds -> (list)

  

  An array of the gateway's local disk IDs that are configured as working storage. Each local disk ID is specified as a string (minimum length of 1 and maximum length of 300). If no local disks are configured as working storage, then the DiskIds array is empty.

  

  (string)

    

    

  

WorkingStorageUsedInBytes -> (long)

  

  The total working storage in bytes in use by the gateway. If no working storage is configured for the gateway, this field returns 0.

  

  

WorkingStorageAllocatedInBytes -> (long)

  

  The total working storage in bytes allocated for the gateway. If no working storage is configured for the gateway, this field returns 0.
