===========
Description
===========



Returns the description of the gateway volumes specified in the request. The list of gateway volumes in the request must be from one gateway. In the response Amazon Storage Gateway returns volume information sorted by volume ARNs. This operation is only supported in stored volume gateway type.

``--volume-arns`` (list)


  An array of strings where each string represents the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a stored volume. All of the specified stored volumes must from the same gateway. Use  ListVolumes to get volume ARNs for a gateway.

  



Syntax::

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

StorediSCSIVolumes -> (list)

  

  (structure)

    

    Describes an iSCSI stored volume.

    

    VolumeARN -> (string)

      

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage volume.

      

      

    VolumeId -> (string)

      

      The unique identifier of the volume, e.g. vol-AE4B946D.

      

      

    VolumeType -> (string)

      

      One of the VolumeType enumeration values describing the type of the volume.

      

      

    VolumeStatus -> (string)

      

      One of the VolumeStatus values that indicates the state of the storage volume.

      

      

    VolumeSizeInBytes -> (long)

      

      The size of the volume in bytes.

      

      

    VolumeProgress -> (double)

      

      Represents the percentage complete if the volume is restoring or bootstrapping that represents the percent of data transferred. This field does not appear in the response if the stored volume is not restoring or bootstrapping.

      

      

    VolumeDiskId -> (string)

      

      The ID of the local disk that was specified in the  CreateStorediSCSIVolume operation.

      

      

    SourceSnapshotId -> (string)

      

      If the stored volume was created from a snapshot, this field contains the snapshot ID used, e.g. snap-78e22663. Otherwise, this field is not included.

      

      

    PreservedExistingData -> (boolean)

      

      Indicates if when the stored volume was created, existing data on the underlying local disk was preserved.

       

      Valid Values: true, false

      

      

    VolumeiSCSIAttributes -> (structure)

      

      An  VolumeiSCSIAttributes object that represents a collection of iSCSI attributes for one stored volume.

      

      TargetARN -> (string)

        

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume target.

        

        

      NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)

        

        The network interface identifier.

        

        

      NetworkInterfacePort -> (integer)

        

        The port used to communicate with iSCSI targets.

        

        

      LunNumber -> (integer)

        

        The logical disk number.

        

        

      ChapEnabled -> (boolean)

        

        Indicates whether mutual CHAP is enabled for the iSCSI target.

        

        

      

    CreatedDate -> (timestamp)

      

      The date the volume was created. Volumes created prior to March 28, 2017 donâ€™t have this time stamp.

      

      

    VolumeUsedInBytes -> (long)

      

      The size of the data stored on the volume in bytes. 

       

      .. note::

         

        This value is not available for volumes created prior to May 13, 2015, until you store data on the volume.

         

      

      

    KMSKey -> (string)

      

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS KMS key used for Amazon S3 server side encryption. This value can only be set when KMSEncrypted is true. Optional.
