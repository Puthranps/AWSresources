===========
Description
===========



Disables a tape gateway when the gateway is no longer functioning. For example, if your gateway VM is damaged, you can disable the gateway so you can recover virtual tapes.

 

Use this operation for a tape gateway that is not reachable or not functioning. This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.

 

.. warning::

   

  Once a gateway is disabled it cannot be enabled.

  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways operation to return a list of gateways for your account and region.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
