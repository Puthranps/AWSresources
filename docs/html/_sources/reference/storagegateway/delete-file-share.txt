Synopsis
========

::

    delete-file-share
  --file-share-arn <value>
  [--force-delete | --no-force-delete]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--file-share-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share to be deleted. 

  

``--force-delete`` | ``--no-force-delete`` (boolean)


  If this value is set to true, the operation deletes a file share immediately and aborts all data uploads to AWS. Otherwise, the file share is not deleted until all data is uploaded to AWS. This process aborts the data upload process, and the file share enters the FORCE_DELETING status.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
