===========
Description
===========



Refreshes the cache for the specified file share. This operation finds objects in the Amazon S3 bucket that were added, removed or replaced since the gateway last listed the bucket's contents and cached the results. This operation is only supported in the file gateway type. You can subscribe to be notified through an Amazon CloudWatch event when your RefreshCache operation completes. For more information, see `Getting Notified About File Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-notification>`__ .

    refresh-cache

=======
Options
=======

``--file-share-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share. 

  

``--folder-list`` (list)


  A comma-separated list of the paths of folders to refresh in the cache. The default is [``"/"`` ]. The default refreshes objects and folders at the root of the Amazon S3 bucket. If ``Recursive`` is set to "true", the entire S3 bucket that the file share has access to is refreshed.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--recursive`` | ``--no-recursive`` (boolean)


  A value that specifies whether to recursively refresh folders in the cache. The refresh includes folders that were in the cache the last time the gateway listed the folder's contents. If this value set to "true", each folder that is listed in ``FolderList`` is recursively updated. Otherwise, subfolders listed in ``FolderList`` are not refreshed. Only objects that are in folders listed directly under ``FolderList`` are found and used for the update. The default is "true".

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
