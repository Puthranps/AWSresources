******************************************
create-snapshot-from-volume-recovery-point
******************************************



===========
Description
===========



Initiates a snapshot of a gateway from a volume recovery point. This operation is only supported in the cached volume gateway type.

 

A volume recovery point is a point in time at which all data of the volume is consistent and from which you can create a snapshot. To get a list of volume recovery point for cached volume gateway, use  ListVolumeRecoveryPoints .

 

In the ``CreateSnapshotFromVolumeRecoveryPoint`` request, you identify the volume by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must also provide a description for the snapshot. When the gateway takes a snapshot of the specified volume, the snapshot and its description appear in the AWS Storage Gateway console. In response, the gateway returns you a snapshot ID. You can use this snapshot ID to check the snapshot progress or later use it when you want to create a volume from a snapshot.

 

.. note::

   

  To list or delete a snapshot, you must use the Amazon EC2 API. For more information, in *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference* .

=======
Options
=======

``--volume-arn`` (string)


``--snapshot-description`` (string)


``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
