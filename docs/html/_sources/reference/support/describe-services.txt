===========
Description
===========



Returns the current list of AWS services and a list of service categories that applies to each one. You then use service names and categories in your  CreateCase requests. Each AWS service has its own set of categories.

 

The service codes and category codes correspond to the values that are displayed in the **Service** and **Category** drop-down lists on the AWS Support Center `Create Case <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create>`__ page. The values in those fields, however, do not necessarily match the service codes and categories returned by the ``DescribeServices`` request. Always use the service codes and categories obtained programmatically. This practice ensures that you always have the most recent set of service and category codes.

``--service-code-list`` (list)


  A JSON-formatted list of service codes available for AWS services.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--language`` (string)


  The ISO 639-1 code for the language in which AWS provides support. AWS Support currently supports English ("en") and Japanese ("ja"). Language parameters must be passed explicitly for operations that take them.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
