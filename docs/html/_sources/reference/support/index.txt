Description
===========

 

The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need detailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types. This service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmatically. It uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.

 

The AWS Support service also exposes a set of `Trusted Advisor <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/>`__ features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks. 

 

The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:

 

 
* **Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels.** The  DescribeServices and  DescribeSeverityLevels operations return AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when you call the  CreateCase operation.  
 
* **Case creation, case details, and case resolution.** The  CreateCase ,  DescribeCases ,  DescribeAttachment , and  ResolveCase operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases. 
 
* **Case communication.** The  DescribeCommunications ,  AddCommunicationToCase , and  AddAttachmentsToSet operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to AWS Support cases.  
 

 

The following list describes the operations available from the AWS Support service for Trusted Advisor:

 

 
*  DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks returns the list of checks that run against your AWS resources. 
 
* Using the ``checkId`` for a specific check returned by  DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks , you can call  DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult to obtain the results for the check you specified. 
 
*  DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries returns summarized results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks. 
 
*  RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified check.  
 
*  DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses reports the refresh status of one or more checks.  
 

 

For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses `Signature Version 4 Signing Process <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`__ .

 

See `About the AWS Support API <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html>`__ in the *AWS Support User Guide* for information about how to use this service to create and manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your resources.
