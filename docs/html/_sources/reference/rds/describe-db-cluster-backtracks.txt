=======
Options
=======

``--db-cluster-identifier`` (string)


  The DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster to be described. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens. 
   
  * First character must be a letter. 
   
  * Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. 
   

   

  Example: ``my-cluster1``  

  

``--backtrack-identifier`` (string)


  If specified, this value is the backtrack identifier of the backtrack to be described.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must contain a valid universally unique identifier (UUID). For more information about UUIDs, see `A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) URN Namespace <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt>`__ . 
   

   

  Example: ``123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000``  

  

``--filters`` (list)


  A filter that specifies one or more DB clusters to describe. Supported filters include the following:

   

   
  * ``db-cluster-backtrack-id`` - Accepts backtrack identifiers. The results list includes information about only the backtracks identified by these identifiers. 
   
  * ``db-cluster-backtrack-status`` - Accepts any of the following backtrack status values: 

     
    * ``applying``   
     
    * ``completed``   
     
    * ``failed``   
     
    * ``pending``   
     

   

  The results list includes information about only the backtracks identified by these values. For more information about backtrack status values, see  DBClusterBacktrack .

   
   

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Name=string,Values=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Name": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--max-records`` (integer)


  The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved. 

   

  Default: 100

   

  Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.

  

``--marker`` (string)


  An optional pagination token provided by a previous  DescribeDBClusterBacktracks request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by ``MaxRecords`` . 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

Marker -> (string)

  

  A pagination token that can be used in a subsequent  DescribeDBClusterBacktracks request.

  

  

DBClusterBacktracks -> (list)

  

  Contains a list of backtracks for the user.

  

  (structure)

    

    This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClusterBacktracks action.

    

    DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)

      

      Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

      

      

    BacktrackIdentifier -> (string)

      

      Contains the backtrack identifier.

      

      

    BacktrackTo -> (timestamp)

      

      The timestamp of the time to which the DB cluster was backtracked.

      

      

    BacktrackedFrom -> (timestamp)

      

      The timestamp of the time from which the DB cluster was backtracked.

      

      

    BacktrackRequestCreationTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The timestamp of the time at which the backtrack was requested.

      

      

    Status -> (string)

      

      The status of the backtrack. This property returns one of the following values:

       

       
      * ``applying`` - The backtrack is currently being applied to or rolled back from the DB cluster. 
       
      * ``completed`` - The backtrack has successfully been applied to or rolled back from the DB cluster. 
       
      * ``failed`` - An error occurred while the backtrack was applied to or rolled back from the DB cluster. 
       
      * ``pending`` - The backtrack is currently pending application to or rollback from the DB cluster.
