===========
Description
===========



Updates a manual DB snapshot, which can be encrypted or not encrypted, with a new engine version. 

 

Amazon RDS supports upgrading DB snapshots for MySQL and Oracle.

Options

``--db-snapshot-identifier`` (string)


  The identifier of the DB snapshot to modify.

  

``--engine-version`` (string)


  The engine version to upgrade the DB snapshot to. 

   

  The following are the database engines and engine versions that are available when you upgrade a DB snapshot. 

   

   **MySQL**  

   

   
  * ``5.5.46`` (supported for 5.1 DB snapshots) 
   

   

   **Oracle**  

   

   
  * ``12.1.0.2.v8`` (supported for 12.1.0.1 DB snapshots) 
   
  * ``11.2.0.4.v12`` (supported for 11.2.0.2 DB snapshots) 
   
  * ``11.2.0.4.v11`` (supported for 11.2.0.3 DB snapshots) 
   

  

``--option-group-name`` (string)


  The option group to identify with the upgraded DB snapshot. 

   

  You can specify this parameter when you upgrade an Oracle DB snapshot. The same option group considerations apply when upgrading a DB snapshot as when upgrading a DB instance. For more information, see `Option Group Considerations <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Oracle.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Oracle.OGPG.OG>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

    (structure)

      

      Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

       

      To specify the number of CPU cores, use the ``coreCount`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the ``threadsPerCore`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter.

       

      You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

       

       
      *  CreateDBInstance   
       
      *  ModifyDBInstance

      *  RestoreDBInstanceFromS3   
       
      *  RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime   
       

       

      You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the  DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions action and specifying the instance class for the ``DBInstanceClass`` parameter.

       

      In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

       

       
      *  DescribeDBInstances   
       
      *  DescribeDBSnapshots   
       
      *  DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications
