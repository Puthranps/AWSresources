===========
Description
===========



Backtracks a DB cluster to a specific time, without creating a new DB cluster.

 

For more information on backtracking, see `Backtracking an Aurora DB Cluster <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.html>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide.*  



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/rds-2014-10-31/BacktrackDBCluster>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

=======
Options
=======

``--db-cluster-identifier`` (string)


  The DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster to be backtracked. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens. 
   
  * First character must be a letter. 
   
  * Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. 
   

   

  Example: ``my-cluster1``  

  

``--backtrack-to`` (timestamp)


  The timestamp of the time to backtrack the DB cluster to, specified in ISO 8601 format. For more information about ISO 8601, see the `ISO8601 Wikipedia page. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`__  

   

  .. note::

     

    If the specified time is not a consistent time for the DB cluster, Aurora automatically chooses the nearest possible consistent time for the DB cluster.

     

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must contain a valid ISO 8601 timestamp. 
   
  * Can't contain a timestamp set in the future. 
   

   

  Example: ``2017-07-08T18:00Z``  

  

``--force`` | ``--no-force`` (boolean)


  A value that, if specified, forces the DB cluster to backtrack when binary logging is enabled. Otherwise, an error occurs when binary logging is enabled.

  

``--use-earliest-time-on-point-in-time-unavailable`` | ``--no-use-earliest-time-on-point-in-time-unavailable`` (boolean)


  If *BacktrackTo* is set to a timestamp earlier than the earliest backtrack time, this value backtracks the DB cluster to the earliest possible backtrack time. Otherwise, an error occurs.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)

  

  Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

  

  

BacktrackIdentifier -> (string)

  

  Contains the backtrack identifier.

  

  

BacktrackTo -> (timestamp)

  

  The timestamp of the time to which the DB cluster was backtracked.

  

  

BacktrackedFrom -> (timestamp)

  

  The timestamp of the time from which the DB cluster was backtracked.

  

  

BacktrackRequestCreationTime -> (timestamp)

  

  The timestamp of the time at which the backtrack was requested.

  

  

Status -> (string)

  

  The status of the backtrack. This property returns one of the following values:

   

   
  * ``applying`` - The backtrack is currently being applied to or rolled back from the DB cluster. 
   
  * ``completed`` - The backtrack has successfully been applied to or rolled back from the DB cluster. 
   
  * ``failed`` - An error occurred while the backtrack was applied to or rolled back from the DB cluster. 
   
  * ``pending`` - The backtrack is currently pending application to or rollback from the DB cluster.
