restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time
************************************



===========
Description
===========



Restores a DB instance to an arbitrary point in time. You can restore to any point in time before the time identified by the LatestRestorableTime property. You can restore to a point up to the number of days specified by the BackupRetentionPeriod property.

 

The target database is created with most of the original configuration, but in a system-selected Availability Zone, with the default security group, the default subnet group, and the default DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a single-AZ deployment except when the instance is a SQL Server instance that has an option group that is associated with mirroring; in this case, the instance becomes a mirrored deployment and not a single-AZ deployment.

 

.. note::

   

  This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL. For Aurora, use  RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime .

Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
