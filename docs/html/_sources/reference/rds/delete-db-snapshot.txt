===========
Description
===========



Deletes a DBSnapshot. If the snapshot is being copied, the copy operation is terminated.

 

.. note::

   

  The DBSnapshot must be in the ``available`` state to be deleted.

::

    delete-db-snapshot
  --db-snapshot-identifier <value>

=======
Options
=======

``--db-snapshot-identifier`` (string)


  The DBSnapshot identifier.

   

  Constraints: Must be the name of an existing DB snapshot in the ``available`` state.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

  ProcessorFeatures -> (list)

    

    The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance when the DB snapshot was created.

    

    (structure)

      

      Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

       

      To specify the number of CPU cores, use the ``coreCount`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the ``threadsPerCore`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter.

       

      You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

       

       
      *  CreateDBInstance   
       
      *  ModifyDBInstance   
       
      *  RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot   
       
      *  RestoreDBInstanceFromS3   
       
      *  RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime   
       

       

      You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the  DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions action and specifying the instance class for the ``DBInstanceClass`` parameter.

       

      In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

       

       
      *  DescribeDBInstances   
       
      *  DescribeDBSnapshots   
       
      *  DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications   
       

       

      For more information, see `Configuring the Processor of the DB Instance Class <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html#USER_ConfigureProcessor>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*  

      

      Name -> (string)

        

        The name of the processor feature. Valid names are ``coreCount`` and ``threadsPerCore`` .

        

        

      Value -> (string)

        

        The value of a processor feature name.
