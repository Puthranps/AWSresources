===========
Description
===========



Returns information about provisioned Aurora DB clusters. This API supports pagination.

 

For more information on Amazon Aurora, see `What Is Amazon Aurora? <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide.*  



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/rds-2014-10-31/DescribeDBClusters>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``describe-db-clusters`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``DBClusters``

=======
Options
=======

``--db-cluster-identifier`` (string)


  The user-supplied DB cluster identifier. If this parameter is specified, information from only the specific DB cluster is returned. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * If supplied, must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier. 
   

  

``--filters`` (list)


  A filter that specifies one or more DB clusters to describe.

   

  Supported filters:

   

   
  * ``db-cluster-id`` - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list will only include information about the DB clusters identified by these ARNs. 
   

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Name=string,Values=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Name": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

Marker -> (string)

  

  A pagination token that can be used in a subsequent DescribeDBClusters request.

  

  

DBClusters -> (list)

  

  Contains a list of DB clusters for the user.

  

  (structure)

    

    Contains the details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster. 

     

    This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClusters ,  StopDBCluster , and  StartDBCluster actions. 

    

    AllocatedStorage -> (integer)

      

      For all database engines except Amazon Aurora, ``AllocatedStorage`` specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB). For Aurora, ``AllocatedStorage`` always returns 1, because Aurora DB cluster storage size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as needed.

      

      

    AvailabilityZones -> (list)

      

      Provides the list of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in the DB cluster can be created in.

      

      (string)

        

        

      

    BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)

      

      Specifies the number of days for which automatic DB snapshots are retained.

      

      

    CharacterSetName -> (string)

      

      If present, specifies the name of the character set that this cluster is associated with.

      

      

    DatabaseName -> (string)

      

      Contains the name of the initial database of this DB cluster that was provided at create time, if one was specified when the DB cluster was created. This same name is returned for the life of the DB cluster.

      

      

    DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)

      

      Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

      

      

    DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)

      

      Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB cluster.

      

      

    DBSubnetGroup -> (string)

      

      Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB cluster, including the name, description, and subnets in the subnet group.

      

      

    Status -> (string)

      

      Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

      

      

    PercentProgress -> (string)

      

      Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

      Specifies the connection endpoint for the primary instance of the DB cluster.

      

      

    ReaderEndpoint -> (string)

      

      The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora Replicas that are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the connection requests among the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. This functionality can help balance your read workload across multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster. 

       

      If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are connected to is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint.

      

      

    MultiAZ -> (boolean)

      

      Specifies whether the DB cluster has instances in multiple Availability Zones.

    AssociatedRoles -> (list)

      

      Provides a list of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles that are associated with the DB cluster. IAM roles that are associated with a DB cluster grant permission for the DB cluster to access other AWS services on your behalf.
