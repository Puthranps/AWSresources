Description
===========



Creates a new Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

 

You can use the ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` parameter to create the DB cluster as a Read Replica of another DB cluster or Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance. For cross-region replication where the DB cluster identified by ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` is encrypted, you must also specify the ``PreSignedUrl`` parameter.

 

For more information on Amazon Aurora, see `What Is Amazon Aurora? <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide.*

Shorthand Syntax::

    Key=string,Value=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",
      "Value": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--storage-encrypted`` | ``--no-storage-encrypted`` (boolean)


  Specifies whether the DB cluster is encrypted.

  

``--kms-key-id`` (string)


  The AWS KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB cluster.

   

  The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are creating a DB cluster with the same AWS account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new DB cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KMS encryption key.

   

  If an encryption key is not specified in ``KmsKeyId`` :

   

   
  * If ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` identifies an encrypted source, then Amazon RDS will use the encryption key used to encrypt the source. Otherwise, Amazon RDS will use your default encryption key.  
   
  * If the ``StorageEncrypted`` parameter is true and ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` is not specified, then Amazon RDS will use your default encryption key. 
   

   

  AWS KMS creates the default encryption key for your AWS account. Your AWS account has a different default encryption key for each AWS Region.

   

  If you create a Read Replica of an encrypted DB cluster in another AWS Region, you must set ``KmsKeyId`` to a KMS key ID that is valid in the destination AWS Region. This key is used to encrypt the Read Replica in that AWS Region.

  

``--pre-signed-url`` (string)


  A URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the ``CreateDBCluster`` action to be called in the source AWS Region where the DB cluster is replicated from. You only need to specify ``PreSignedUrl`` when you are performing cross-region replication from an encrypted DB cluster.

   

  The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the ``CreateDBCluster`` API action that can be executed in the source AWS Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster to be copied.

   

  The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values:

   

   
  * ``KmsKeyId`` - The AWS KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster in the destination AWS Region. This should refer to the same KMS key for both the ``CreateDBCluster`` action that is called in the destination AWS Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL. 
   
  * ``DestinationRegion`` - The name of the AWS Region that Aurora Read Replica will be created in. 
   
  * ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` - The DB cluster identifier for the encrypted DB cluster to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source AWS Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster from the us-west-2 AWS Region, then your ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` would look like Example: ``arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:aurora-cluster1`` . 
   

   

  To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see `Authenticating Requests\: Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4) <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html>`__ and `Signature Version 4 Signing Process <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`__ .

  

``--enable-iam-database-authentication`` | ``--no-enable-iam-database-authentication`` (boolean)


  True to enable mapping of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts, and otherwise false.

   

  Default: ``false``  

  

``--backtrack-window`` (long)


  The target backtrack window, in seconds. To disable backtracking, set this value to 0. 

   

  Default: 0

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * If specified, this value must be set to a number from 0 to 259,200 (72 hours). 
   

  

``--enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports`` (list)


  The list of log types that need to be enabled for exporting to CloudWatch Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine being used. For more information, see `Publishing Database Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html#USER_LogAccess.Procedural.UploadtoCloudWatch>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide* .

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--engine-mode`` (string)


  The DB engine mode of the DB cluster, either ``provisioned`` , ``serverless`` , or ``parallelquery`` .

  

``--scaling-configuration`` (structure)


  For DB clusters in ``serverless`` DB engine mode, the scaling properties of the DB cluster.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    MinCapacity=integer,MaxCapacity=integer,AutoPause=boolean,SecondsUntilAutoPause=integer




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "MinCapacity": integer,
    "MaxCapacity": integer,
    "AutoPause": true|false,
    "SecondsUntilAutoPause": integer
  }



``--deletion-protection`` | ``--no-deletion-protection`` (boolean)


  Indicates if the DB cluster should have deletion protection enabled. The database can't be deleted when this value is set to true. The default is false. 

  

``--source-region`` (string)


  The ID of the region that contains the source for the db cluster.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

  This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClusters ,  StopDBCluster , and  StartDBCluster actions. 

  

  AllocatedStorage -> (integer)

    

    For all database engines except Amazon Aurora, ``AllocatedStorage`` specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB). For Aurora, ``AllocatedStorage`` always returns 1, because Aurora DB cluster storage size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as needed.

    

    

  AvailabilityZones -> (list)

    

    Provides the list of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in the DB cluster can be created in.

    

    (string)

  DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)

    

    Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB cluster.

    

    

  DBSubnetGroup -> (string)

    

    Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB cluster, including the name, description, and subnets in the subnet group.

This functionality can help balance your read workload across multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster. 

     

    If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are connected to is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint.
