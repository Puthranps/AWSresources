===========
Description
===========



Promotes a Read Replica DB instance to a standalone DB instance.

 

.. note::

   

   
  * Backup duration is a function of the amount of changes to the database since the previous backup. If you plan to promote a Read Replica to a standalone instance, we recommend that you enable backups and complete at least one backup prior to promotion. In addition, a Read Replica cannot be promoted to a standalone instance when it is in the ``backing-up`` status. If you have enabled backups on your Read Replica, configure the automated backup window so that daily backups do not interfere with Read Replica promotion. 
   
  * This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL.

=======
Options
=======

``--db-instance-identifier`` (string)


  The DB instance identifier. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must match the identifier of an existing Read Replica DB instance. 
   

   

  Example: ``mydbinstance``  

  

``--backup-retention-period`` (integer)


  The number of days to retain automated backups. Setting this parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables automated backups.

   

  Default: 1

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must be a value from 0 to 8 
   

  

``--preferred-backup-window`` (string)


  The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, using the ``BackupRetentionPeriod`` parameter. 

   

  The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region. To see the time blocks available, see `Adjusting the Preferred Maintenance Window <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/AdjustingTheMaintenanceWindow.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*  

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must be in the format ``hh24:mi-hh24:mi`` . 
   
  * Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). 
   
  * Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window. 
   
  * Must be at least 30 minutes. 
   

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

  PromotionTier -> (integer)

    

    A value that specifies the order in which an Aurora Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a failure of the existing primary instance. For more information, see `Fault Tolerance for an Aurora DB Cluster <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Backups.html#Aurora.Managing.FaultTolerance>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide* . 

    

    

  DBInstanceArn -> (string)

    

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB instance.

    

    

  Timezone -> (string)

    

    The time zone of the DB instance. In most cases, the ``Timezone`` element is empty. ``Timezone`` content appears only for Microsoft SQL Server DB instances that were created with a time zone specified. 

    

    

  IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled -> (boolean)

    

    True if mapping of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts is enabled, and otherwise false.

     

    IAM database authentication can be enabled for the following database engines

     

     
    * For MySQL 5.6, minor version 5.6.34 or higher 
     
    * For MySQL 5.7, minor version 5.7.16 or higher 
     
    * Aurora 5.6 or higher. To enable IAM database authentication for Aurora, see DBCluster Type. 
     

    

    

  PerformanceInsightsEnabled -> (boolean)

    

    True if Performance Insights is enabled for the DB instance, and otherwise false.

    

    

  PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId -> (string)

    

    The AWS KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data. The KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key alias for the KMS encryption key.

    

    

  PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod -> (integer)

    

    The amount of time, in days, to retain Performance Insights data. Valid values are 7 or 731 (2 years). 

    

    

  EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports -> (list)

    

    A list of log types that this DB instance is configured to export to CloudWatch Logs.

     

    Log types vary by DB engine. For information about the log types for each DB engine, see `Amazon RDS Database Log Files <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*  

    

    (string)

      

      

    

  ProcessorFeatures -> (list)

    

    The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance.

    

    (structure)

      

      Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

       

      To specify the number of CPU cores, use the ``coreCount`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the ``threadsPerCore`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter.

       

      You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

       

       
      *  CreateDBInstance   
       
      *  ModifyDBInstance   
       
      *  RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot   
       
      *  RestoreDBInstanceFromS3   
       
      *  RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime   
       

       

      You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the  DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions action and specifying the instance class for the ``DBInstanceClass`` parameter.

       

      In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

       

       
      *  DescribeDBInstances   
       
      *  DescribeDBSnapshots   
       
      *  DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications   
       

       

      For more information, see `Configuring the Processor of the DB Instance Class <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html#USER_ConfigureProcessor>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*  

      

      Name -> (string)

        

        The name of the processor feature. Valid names are ``coreCount`` and ``threadsPerCore`` .

        

        

      Value -> (string)

        

        The value of a processor feature name.

        

        

      

    

  DeletionProtection -> (boolean)

    

    Indicates if the DB instance has deletion protection enabled. The database can't be deleted when this value is set to true. For more information, see `Deleting a DB Instance <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DeleteInstance.html>`__ .
