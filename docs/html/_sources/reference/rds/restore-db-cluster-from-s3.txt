``--storage-encrypted`` | ``--no-storage-encrypted`` (boolean)


  Specifies whether the restored DB cluster is encrypted.

  

``--kms-key-id`` (string)


  The AWS KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB cluster.

   

  The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are creating a DB cluster with the same AWS account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new DB cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KM encryption key.

   

  If the ``StorageEncrypted`` parameter is true, and you do not specify a value for the ``KmsKeyId`` parameter, then Amazon RDS will use your default encryption key.

  Example: ``5.6.22``  

  

``--s3-bucket-name`` (string)


  The name of the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the data used to create the Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

  

``--s3-prefix`` (string)


  The prefix for all of the file names that contain the data used to create the Amazon Aurora DB cluster. If you do not specify a **SourceS3Prefix** value, then the Amazon Aurora DB cluster is created by using all of the files in the Amazon S3 bucket.

  

``--s3-ingestion-role-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that authorizes Amazon RDS to access the Amazon S3 bucket on your behalf.

  

``--backtrack-window`` (long)


  The target backtrack window, in seconds. To disable backtracking, set this value to 0.

   

  Default: 0

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * If specified, this value must be set to a number from 0 to 259,200 (72 hours). 
   

  

``--enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports`` (list)


  The list of logs that the restored DB cluster is to export to CloudWatch Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine being used. For more information, see `Publishing Database Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html#USER_LogAccess.Procedural.UploadtoCloudWatch>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide* .

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--deletion-protection`` | ``--no-deletion-protection`` (boolean)


  Indicates if the DB cluster should have deletion protection enabled. The database can't be deleted when this value is set to true. The default is false. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

DBCluster -> (structure)

  

  Contains the details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster. 

   

  This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClusters ,  StopDBCluster , and  StartDBCluster actions. 

  

  AllocatedStorage -> (integer)

    

    For all database engines except Amazon Aurora, ``AllocatedStorage`` specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB). For Aurora, ``AllocatedStorage`` always returns 1, because Aurora DB cluster storage size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as needed.

    

    

  AvailabilityZones -> (list)

    

    Provides the list of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in the DB cluster can be created in.

    

    (string)

    Specifies the number of days for which automatic DB snapshots are retained.

    

    

  CharacterSetName -> (string)

    

    If present, specifies the name of the character set that this cluster is associated with.

    

    

  DatabaseName -> (string)

  DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)

    

    Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB cluster.

    

    

  DBSubnetGroup -> (string)

    

    Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB cluster, including the name, description, and subnets in the subnet group.

    

    

  Status -> (string)

    

    Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

This functionality can help balance your read workload across multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster. 

     

    If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are connected to is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint.
