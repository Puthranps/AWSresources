reboot-db-instance
******************



===========
Description
===========



You might need to reboot your DB instance, usually for maintenance reasons. For example, if you make certain modifications, or if you change the DB parameter group associated with the DB instance, you must reboot the instance for the changes to take effect. 

 

Rebooting a DB instance restarts the database engine service. Rebooting a DB instance results in a momentary outage, during which the DB instance status is set to rebooting. 

 

For more information about rebooting, see `Rebooting a DB Instance <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RebootInstance.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*  



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/rds-2014-10-31/RebootDBInstance>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis

::

    reboot-db-instance
  --db-instance-identifier <value>
  [--force-failover | --no-force-failover]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--db-instance-identifier`` (string)


  The DB instance identifier. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance. 
   

  

``--force-failover`` | ``--no-force-failover`` (boolean)


  When ``true`` , the reboot is conducted through a MultiAZ failover. 

   

  Constraint: You can't specify ``true`` if the instance is not configured for MultiAZ.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

    * For MySQL 5.6, minor version 5.6.34 or higher 
     
    * For MySQL 5.7, minor version 5.7.16 or higher 
     
    * Aurora 5.6 or higher. To enable IAM database authentication for Aurora, see DBCluster Type. 
     

    

    

  PerformanceInsightsEnabled -> (boolean)

    

    True if Performance Insights is enabled for the DB instance, and otherwise false.

    

    

  PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId -> (string)

    

    The AWS KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data. The KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key alias for the KMS encryption key.

    

    

  PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod -> (integer)

    

    The amount of time, in days, to retain Performance Insights data. Valid values are 7 or 731 (2 years). 

    

    

  EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports -> (list)

    

    A list of log types that this DB instance is configured to export to CloudWatch Logs.

     

    Log types vary by DB engine. For information about the log types for each DB engine, see `Amazon RDS Database Log Files <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*  

    

    (string)

      

      

    

  ProcessorFeatures -> (list)

    

    The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance.

    

    (structure)

      

      Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

       

      To specify the number of CPU cores, use the ``coreCount`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the ``threadsPerCore`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter.

       

      You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

       

       
      *  CreateDBInstance   
       
      *  ModifyDBInstance   
       
      *  RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot   
       
      *  RestoreDBInstanceFromS3   
       
      *  RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime   
       

       

      You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the  DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions action and specifying the instance class for the ``DBInstanceClass`` parameter.

       

      In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

       

       
      *  DescribeDBInstances   
       
      *  DescribeDBSnapshots   
       
      *  DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications   
       

       

      For more information, see `Configuring the Processor of the DB Instance Class <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html#USER_ConfigureProcessor>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*  

      

      Name -> (string)

        

        The name of the processor feature. Valid names are ``coreCount`` and ``threadsPerCore`` .

        

        

      Value -> (string)

        

        The value of a processor feature name.

        

        

      

    

  DeletionProtection -> (boolean)

    

    Indicates if the DB instance has deletion protection enabled. The database can't be deleted when this value is set to true. For more information, see `Deleting a DB Instance <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DeleteInstance.html>`__ .
