***********************************



===========
Description
===========



Restores a DB cluster to an arbitrary point in time. Users can restore to any point in time before ``LatestRestorableTime`` for up to ``BackupRetentionPeriod`` days. The target DB cluster is created from the source DB cluster with the same configuration as the original DB cluster, except that the new DB cluster is created with the default DB security group. 

 

.. note::

   

  This action only restores the DB cluster, not the DB instances for that DB cluster. You must invoke the  CreateDBInstance action to create DB instances for the restored DB cluster, specifying the identifier of the restored DB cluster in ``DBClusterIdentifier`` . You can create DB instances only after the ``RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime`` action has completed and the DB cluster is available.

  * Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens 
   
  * First character must be a letter 
   
  * Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens 
   

  

``--restore-type`` (string)


  The type of restore to be performed. You can specify one of the following values:

   

   
  * ``full-copy`` - The new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster. 
   
  * ``copy-on-write`` - The new DB cluster is restored as a clone of the source DB cluster. 
   

   

  Constraints: You can't specify ``copy-on-write`` if the engine version of the source DB cluster is earlier than 1.11.

   

  If you don't specify a ``RestoreType`` value, then the new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster.

  

``--source-db-cluster-identifier`` (string)


  The identifier of the source DB cluster from which to restore.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster. 
   

  

``--restore-to-time`` (timestamp)


  The date and time to restore the DB cluster to.

   

  Valid Values: Value must be a time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) format

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must be before the latest restorable time for the DB instance 
   
  * Must be specified if ``UseLatestRestorableTime`` parameter is not provided 
   
  * Can't be specified if ``UseLatestRestorableTime`` parameter is true 
   
  * Can't be specified if ``RestoreType`` parameter is ``copy-on-write``   
   

   

  Example: ``2015-03-07T23:45:00Z``  

  

``--use-latest-restorable-time`` | ``--no-use-latest-restorable-time`` (boolean)


  A value that is set to ``true`` to restore the DB cluster to the latest restorable backup time, and ``false`` otherwise. 

   

  Default: ``false``  

   

  Constraints: Can't be specified if ``RestoreToTime`` parameter is provided.

  

``--port`` (integer)


  The port number on which the new DB cluster accepts connections.

   

  Constraints: A value from ``1150-65535`` . 

   

  Default: The default port for the engine.

  

``--db-subnet-group-name`` (string)


  The DB subnet group name to use for the new DB cluster.

   

  Constraints: If supplied, must match the name of an existing DBSubnetGroup.

   

  Example: ``mySubnetgroup``  

  

``--option-group-name`` (string)


  The name of the option group for the new DB cluster.

  

``--vpc-security-group-ids`` (list)


  A list of VPC security groups that the new DB cluster belongs to.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--tags`` (list)


  A list of tags. For more information, see `Tagging Amazon RDS Resources <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*  

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Key=string,Value=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",
      "Value": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--kms-key-id`` (string)


  The AWS KMS key identifier to use when restoring an encrypted DB cluster from an encrypted DB cluster.

   

  The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are restoring a DB cluster with the same AWS account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new DB cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KMS encryption key.

   

  You can restore to a new DB cluster and encrypt the new DB cluster with a KMS key that is different than the KMS key used to encrypt the source DB cluster. The new DB cluster is encrypted with the KMS key identified by the ``KmsKeyId`` parameter.

   

  If you don't specify a value for the ``KmsKeyId`` parameter, then the following occurs:

   

   
  * If the DB cluster is encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is encrypted using the KMS key that was used to encrypt the source DB cluster. 
   
  * If the DB cluster is not encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is not encrypted. 
   

   

  If ``DBClusterIdentifier`` refers to a DB cluster that is not encrypted, then the restore request is rejected.

  

``--enable-iam-database-authentication`` | ``--no-enable-iam-database-authentication`` (boolean)


  True to enable mapping of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts, and otherwise false.

   

  Default: ``false``  

  

``--backtrack-window`` (long)


  The target backtrack window, in seconds. To disable backtracking, set this value to 0.

   

  Default: 0

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * If specified, this value must be set to a number from 0 to 259,200 (72 hours). 
   

  

``--enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports`` (list)


  The list of logs that the restored DB cluster is to export to CloudWatch Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine being used. For more information, see `Publishing Database Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html#USER_LogAccess.Procedural.UploadtoCloudWatch>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide* .

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--db-cluster-parameter-group-name`` (string)


  The name of the DB cluster parameter group to associate with this DB cluster. If this argument is omitted, the default DB cluster parameter group for the specified engine is used.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * If supplied, must match the name of an existing DB cluster parameter group. 
   
  * Must be 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens. 
   
  * First character must be a letter. 
   
  * Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. 
   

  

``--deletion-protection`` | ``--no-deletion-protection`` (boolean)


  Indicates if the DB cluster should have deletion protection enabled. The database can't be deleted when this value is set to true. The default is false. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

  This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClusters ,  StopDBCluster , and  StartDBCluster actions. 

  

  AllocatedStorage -> (integer)

    

    For all database engines except Amazon Aurora, ``AllocatedStorage`` specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB). For Aurora, ``AllocatedStorage`` always returns 1, because Aurora DB cluster storage size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as needed.

    

    

  AvailabilityZones -> (list)

    

    Provides the list of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in the DB cluster can be created in.

    

    (string)

    Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB cluster.

    

    

  DBSubnetGroup -> (string)

    

    Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB cluster, including the name, description, and subnets in the subnet group.

    

    

  Status -> (string)

    

    Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.
