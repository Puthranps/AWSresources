  * First character must be a letter. 
   
  * Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. 
   

   

  Example: ``my-cluster1-snapshot1``  

  

``--db-cluster-identifier`` (string)


  The identifier of the DB cluster to create a snapshot for. This parameter is not case-sensitive.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster. 
   

   

  Example: ``my-cluster1``  

  

``--tags`` (list)

Shorthand Syntax::

    Key=string,Value=string ...

      "Value": "string"
    }

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
