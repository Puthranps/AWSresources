Options

``--exclusion-arns`` (list)


  The list of ARNs that specify the exclusions that you want to describe.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--locale`` (string)


  The locale into which you want to translate the exclusion's title, description, and recommendation.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``EN_US``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
