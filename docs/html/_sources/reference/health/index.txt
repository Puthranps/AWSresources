Description
===========

 

The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health information that is presented in the `AWS Personal Health Dashboard <https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/>`__ . You can get information about events that affect your AWS resources:

 

 
*  DescribeEvents : Summary information about events. 
 
*  DescribeEventDetails : Detailed information about one or more events. 
 
*  DescribeAffectedEntities : Information about AWS resources that are affected by one or more events. 
 

 

In addition, these operations provide information about event types and summary counts of events or affected entities:

 

 
*  DescribeEventTypes : Information about the kinds of events that AWS Health tracks. 
 
*  DescribeEventAggregates : A count of the number of events that meet specified criteria. 
 
*  DescribeEntityAggregates : A count of the number of affected entities that meet specified criteria. 
 

 

The Health API requires a Business or Enterprise support plan from `AWS Support <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/>`__ . Calling the Health API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan causes a ``SubscriptionRequiredException`` . 

 

For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the `Signature Version 4 Signing Process <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`__ .

 

See the `AWS Health User Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html>`__ for information about how to use the API.
