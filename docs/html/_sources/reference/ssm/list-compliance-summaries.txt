Options
=======

``--filters`` (list)


  One or more compliance or inventory filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list of results.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Key=string,Values=string,string,Type=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...],
      "Type": "EQUAL"|"NOT_EQUAL"|"BEGIN_WITH"|"LESS_THAN"|"GREATER_THAN"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--next-token`` (string)


  A token to start the list. Use this token to get the next set of results. 

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of items to return for this call. Currently, you can specify null or 50. The call also returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the next set of results.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
