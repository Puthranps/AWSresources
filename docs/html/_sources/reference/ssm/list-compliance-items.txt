=======
Options
=======

``--filters`` (list)


  One or more compliance filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list of results.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Key=string,Values=string,string,Type=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...],
      "Type": "EQUAL"|"NOT_EQUAL"|"BEGIN_WITH"|"LESS_THAN"|"GREATER_THAN"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--resource-ids`` (list)


  The ID for the resources from which to get compliance information. Currently, you can only specify one resource ID.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--resource-types`` (list)


  The type of resource from which to get compliance information. Currently, the only supported resource type is ``ManagedInstance`` .

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--next-token`` (string)


  A token to start the list. Use this token to get the next set of results. 

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of items to return for this call. The call also returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the next set of results.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

ComplianceItems -> (list)

  

  A list of compliance information for the specified resource ID. 

  

  (structure)

    ComplianceType -> (string)

      

      The compliance type. For example, Association (for a State Manager association), Patch, or Custom:``string`` are all valid compliance types.

      

      

    ResourceType -> (string)

      

      The type of resource. ``ManagedInstance`` is currently the only supported resource type.

      

      

    ResourceId -> (string)

      

      An ID for the resource. For a managed instance, this is the instance ID.

      

      

    Id -> (string)

      ExecutionTime -> (timestamp)

        

        The time the execution ran as a datetime object that is saved in the following format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'.

        

        

      ExecutionId -> (string)

        

        An ID created by the system when ``PutComplianceItems`` was called. For example, ``CommandID`` is a valid execution ID. You can use this ID in subsequent calls.

        

        

      ExecutionType -> (string)
