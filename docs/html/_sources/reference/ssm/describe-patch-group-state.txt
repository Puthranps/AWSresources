::

    describe-patch-group-state
  --patch-group <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]

Options
=======

``--patch-group`` (string)


  The name of the patch group whose patch snapshot should be retrieved.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples
========

**To get the state of a patch group**

This example gets the high-level patch compliance summary for a patch group.

Command::

  aws ssm describe-patch-group-state --patch-group "Production"

Output::

  {
    "InstancesWithNotApplicablePatches": 0,
    "InstancesWithMissingPatches": 0,
    "InstancesWithFailedPatches": 1,
    "InstancesWithInstalledOtherPatches": 4,
    "Instances": 4,
    "InstancesWithInstalledPatches": 3
  }


======
Output
======

Instances -> (integer)

  

  The number of instances in the patch group.

  

  

InstancesWithInstalledPatches -> (integer)

  

  The number of instances with installed patches.

  

  

InstancesWithInstalledOtherPatches -> (integer)

  

  The number of instances with patches installed that aren't defined in the patch baseline.

  

  

InstancesWithInstalledRejectedPatches -> (integer)

  

  The number of instances with patches installed that are specified in a RejectedPatches list. Patches with a status of *InstalledRejected* were typically installed before they were added to a RejectedPatches list.

   

  .. note::

     

    If ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY is the specified option for RejectedPatchesAction, the value of InstancesWithInstalledRejectedPatches will always be 0 (zero).

     

  

  

InstancesWithMissingPatches -> (integer)

  

  The number of instances with missing patches from the patch baseline.

  

  

InstancesWithFailedPatches -> (integer)

  

  The number of instances with patches from the patch baseline that failed to install.
