Synopsis

    delete-inventory
  --type-name <value>
  [--schema-delete-option <value>]

  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--type-name`` (string)


  The name of the custom inventory type for which you want to delete either all previously collected data, or the inventory type itself. 

  

``--schema-delete-option`` (string)


  Use the ``SchemaDeleteOption`` to delete a custom inventory type (schema). If you don't choose this option, the system only deletes existing inventory data associated with the custom inventory type. Choose one of the following options:

   

  DisableSchema: If you choose this option, the system ignores all inventory data for the specified version, and any earlier versions. To enable this schema again, you must call the ``PutInventory`` action for a version greater than the disbled version.

   

  DeleteSchema: This option deletes the specified custom type from the Inventory service. You can recreate the schema later, if you want.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``DisableSchema``

  
  *   ``DeleteSchema``

  

  

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Use this option to view a summary of the deletion request without deleting any data or the data type. This option is useful when you only want to understand what will be deleted. Once you validate that the data to be deleted is what you intend to delete, you can run the same command without specifying the ``DryRun`` option.

  

``--client-token`` (string)


  User-provided idempotency token.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Output

DeletionId -> (string)
