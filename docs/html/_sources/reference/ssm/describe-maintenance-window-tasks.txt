Synopsis

::

    describe-maintenance-window-tasks
  --window-id <value>
  [--filters <value>]
  [--max-results <value>]
  [--next-token <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--window-id`` (string)


  The ID of the Maintenance Window whose tasks should be retrieved.

  

``--filters`` (list)


  Optional filters used to narrow down the scope of the returned tasks. The supported filter keys are WindowTaskId, TaskArn, Priority, and TaskType.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Key=string,Values=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of items to return for this call. The call also returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the next set of results.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a previous call.)

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

      The task ID.

      

      

    TaskArn -> (string)

      

      The resource that the task uses during execution. For RUN_COMMAND and AUTOMATION task types, ``TaskArn`` is the Systems Manager document name or ARN. For LAMBDA tasks, it's the function name or ARN. For STEP_FUNCTION tasks, it's the state machine ARN.

      

      

    Type -> (string)

      

      The type of task. The type can be one of the following: RUN_COMMAND, AUTOMATION, LAMBDA, or STEP_FUNCTION.

      

      

    Targets -> (list)

      

      The targets (either instances or tags). Instances are specified using Key=instanceids,Values=<instanceid1>,<instanceid2>. Tags are specified using Key=<tag name>,Values=<tag value>.

      

      (structure)

        

        An array of search criteria that targets instances using a Key,Value combination that you specify. ``Targets`` is required if you don't provide one or more instance IDs in the call.

         

        

        

        Key -> (string)

          

          User-defined criteria for sending commands that target instances that meet the criteria. Key can be tag:<Amazon EC2 tag> or InstanceIds. For more information about how to send commands that target instances using Key,Value parameters, see `Targeting Multiple Instances <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html#send-commands-targeting>`__ in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide* .

          User-defined criteria that maps to Key. For example, if you specified tag:ServerRole, you could specify value:WebServer to execute a command on instances that include Amazon EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer. For more information about how to send commands that target instances using Key,Value parameters, see `Sending Commands to a Fleet <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html>`__ in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide* .

      .. note::

         

         ``TaskParameters`` has been deprecated. To specify parameters to pass to a task when it runs, instead use the ``Parameters`` option in the ``TaskInvocationParameters`` structure. For information about how Systems Manager handles these options for the supported Maintenance Window task types, see  MaintenanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters .

         

      

      key -> (string)

        

        

      value -> (structure)

        

        Defines the values for a task parameter.

        

        Values -> (list)

          

          This field contains an array of 0 or more strings, each 1 to 255 characters in length.

         ``LoggingInfo`` has been deprecated. To specify an S3 bucket to contain logs, instead use the ``OutputS3BucketName`` and ``OutputS3KeyPrefix`` options in the ``TaskInvocationParameters`` structure. For information about how Systems Manager handles these options for the supported Maintenance Window task types, see  MaintenanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters .

         

      

      S3BucketName -> (string)
