``--state`` (string)


  The session status to retrieve a list of sessions for. For example, "Active".

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``Active``

  
  *   ``History``

  

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of items to return for this call. The call also returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the next set of results.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a previous call.)

  

``--filters`` (list)


  One or more filters to limit the type of sessions returned by the request.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    key=string,value=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "key": "InvokedAfter"|"InvokedBefore"|"Target"|"Owner"|"Status",
      "value": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
