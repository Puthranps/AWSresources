  }



``--approved-patches`` (list)


  A list of explicitly approved patches for the baseline.

   

  For information about accepted formats for lists of approved patches and rejected patches, see `Package Name Formats for Approved and Rejected Patch Lists <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-approved-rejected-package-name-formats.html>`__ in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide* .

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--approved-patches-compliance-level`` (string)


  Assigns a new compliance severity level to an existing patch baseline.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``CRITICAL``

  
  *   ``HIGH``

  
  *   ``MEDIUM``

  
  *   ``LOW``

  
  *   ``INFORMATIONAL``

``--approved-patches-enable-non-security`` | ``--no-approved-patches-enable-non-security`` (boolean)


  Indicates whether the list of approved patches includes non-security updates that should be applied to the instances. The default value is 'false'. Applies to Linux instances only.

  

``--rejected-patches`` (list)


  A list of explicitly rejected patches for the baseline.

   

  For information about accepted formats for lists of approved patches and rejected patches, see `Package Name Formats for Approved and Rejected Patch Lists <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-approved-rejected-package-name-formats.html>`__ in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide* .

``--rejected-patches-action`` (string)


  The action for Patch Manager to take on patches included in the RejectedPackages list.

   

   
  * **ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY** : A package in the Rejected patches list is installed only if it is a dependency of another package. It is considered compliant with the patch baseline, and its status is reported as *InstalledOther* . This is the default action if no option is specified. 
   
  * **BLOCK** : Packages in the RejectedPatches list, and packages that include them as dependencies, are not installed under any circumstances. If a package was installed before it was added to the Rejected patches list, it is considered non-compliant with the patch baseline, and its status is reported as *InstalledRejected* . 
   

  

  Possible values:

      "Configuration": "string"
    }

  ]



``--replace`` | ``--no-replace`` (boolean)


  If True, then all fields that are required by the CreatePatchBaseline action are also required for this API request. Optional fields that are not specified are set to null.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

            Defines a patch filter.

             

            A patch filter consists of key/value pairs, but not all keys are valid for all operating system types. For example, the key ``PRODUCT`` is valid for all supported operating system types. The key ``MSRC_SEVERITY`` , however, is valid only for Windows operating systems, and the key ``SECTION`` is valid only for Ubuntu operating systems.

        A compliance severity level for all approved patches in a patch baseline. Valid compliance severity levels include the following: Unspecified, Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Informational.

        

        

      ApproveAfterDays -> (integer)

        

        The number of days after the release date of each patch matched by the rule that the patch is marked as approved in the patch baseline. For example, a value of ``7`` means that patches are approved seven days after they are released. 

        

        

      EnableNonSecurity -> (boolean)
