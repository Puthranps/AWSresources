Synopsis

::

    list-clusters
  [--max-results <value>]
  [--next-token <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of cluster results returned by ``ListClusters`` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ``ListClusters`` only returns ``maxResults`` results in a single page along with a ``nextToken`` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ``ListClusters`` request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used, then ``ListClusters`` returns up to 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value if applicable.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous paginated ``ListClusters`` request where ``maxResults`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value.

   

  .. note::

     

    This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.

     

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

**To list your available clusters**

This example command lists all of your available clusters in your default region.

Command::

Output::

    {
        "clusters": [
            "devel",
            "prod"
        ]
    }


======
Output
======

clusters -> (list)

  

  A list of all of the clusters for your account in the specified Region.

  

  (string)

    

    

  

nextToken -> (string)

  

  The ``nextToken`` value to include in a future ``ListClusters`` request. When the results of a ``ListClusters`` request exceed ``maxResults`` , this value can be used to retrieve the next page of results. This value is ``null`` when there are no more results to return.
