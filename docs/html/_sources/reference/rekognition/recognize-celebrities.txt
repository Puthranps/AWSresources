===========
Description
===========



Returns an array of celebrities recognized in the input image. For more information, see Recognizing Celebrities in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. 

 

 ``RecognizeCelebrities`` returns the 100 largest faces in the image. It lists recognized celebrities in the ``CelebrityFaces`` array and unrecognized faces in the ``UnrecognizedFaces`` array. ``RecognizeCelebrities`` doesn't return celebrities whose faces aren't among the largest 100 faces in the image.

 

For each celebrity recognized, ``RecognizeCelebrities`` returns a ``Celebrity`` object. The ``Celebrity`` object contains the celebrity name, ID, URL links to additional information, match confidence, and a ``ComparedFace`` object that you can use to locate the celebrity's face on the image.

 

Amazon Rekognition doesn't retain information about which images a celebrity has been recognized in. Your application must store this information and use the ``Celebrity`` ID property as a unique identifier for the celebrity. If you don't store the celebrity name or additional information URLs returned by ``RecognizeCelebrities`` , you will need the ID to identify the celebrity in a call to the operation.

 

You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. 

 

For an example, see Recognizing Celebrities in an Image in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

 

This operation requires permissions to perform the ``rekognition:RecognizeCelebrities`` operation.

Options

``--image`` (structure)


  The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes is not supported. 

  

  To specify a local file use ``--image-bytes`` instead.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Bytes=blob,S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "Bytes": blob,
    "S3Object": {
      "Bucket": "string",
      "Name": "string",
      "Version": "string"
    }
  }



``--image-bytes`` (blob)


  The content of the image to be uploaded. To specify the content of a local file use the fileb:// prefix. Example: fileb://image.png

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

      Sharpness -> (float)

        

        Value representing sharpness of the face. The service returns a value between 0 and 100 (inclusive). A higher value indicates a sharper face image.

        

        

      

    

  

OrientationCorrection -> (string)

  

  The orientation of the input image (counterclockwise direction). If your application displays the image, you can use this value to correct the orientation. The bounding box coordinates returned in ``CelebrityFaces`` and ``UnrecognizedFaces`` represent face locations before the image orientation is corrected. 

   

  .. note::

     

    If the input image is in .jpeg format, it might contain exchangeable image (Exif) metadata that includes the image's orientation. If so, and the Exif metadata for the input image populates the orientation field, the value of ``OrientationCorrection`` is null. The ``CelebrityFaces`` and ``UnrecognizedFaces`` bounding box coordinates represent face locations after Exif metadata is used to correct the image orientation. Images in .png format don't contain Exif metadata.
