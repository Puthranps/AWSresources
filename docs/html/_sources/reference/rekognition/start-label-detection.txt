===========
Description
===========



Starts asynchronous detection of labels in a stored video.

 

Amazon Rekognition Video can detect labels in a video. Labels are instances of real-world entities. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; concepts like landscape, evening, and nature; and activities like a person getting out of a car or a person skiing.

 

The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use  Video to specify the bucket name and the filename of the video. ``StartLabelDetection`` returns a job identifier (``JobId`` ) which you use to get the results of the operation. When label detection is finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in ``NotificationChannel`` .

 

To get the results of the label detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is ``SUCCEEDED`` . If so, call and pass the job identifier (``JobId`` ) from the initial call to ``StartLabelDetection`` .

=======
Options
=======

``--video`` (structure)


  The video in which you want to detect labels. The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "S3Object": {
      "Bucket": "string",
      "Name": "string",
      "Version": "string"
    }
  }



``--client-request-token`` (string)


  Idempotent token used to identify the start request. If you use the same token with multiple ``StartLabelDetection`` requests, the same ``JobId`` is returned. Use ``ClientRequestToken`` to prevent the same job from being accidently started more than once. 

  

``--min-confidence`` (float)


  Specifies the minimum confidence that Amazon Rekognition Video must have in order to return a detected label. Confidence represents how certain Amazon Rekognition is that a label is correctly identified.0 is the lowest confidence. 100 is the highest confidence. Amazon Rekognition Video doesn't return any labels with a confidence level lower than this specified value.

   

  If you don't specify ``MinConfidence`` , the operation returns labels with confidence values greater than or equal to 50 percent.

  

``--notification-channel`` (structure)


  The Amazon SNS topic ARN you want Amazon Rekognition Video to publish the completion status of the label detection operation to. 

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "SNSTopicArn": "string",
    "RoleArn": "string"
  }



``--job-tag`` (string)


  Unique identifier you specify to identify the job in the completion status published to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Output
======

JobId -> (string)

  

  The identifier for the label detection job. Use ``JobId`` to identify the job in a subsequent call to ``GetLabelDetection`` .
