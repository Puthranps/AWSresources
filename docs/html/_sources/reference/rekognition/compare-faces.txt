===========
Description
===========



Compares a face in the *source* input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the *target* input image. 

 

.. note::

   

  If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image. 

   

 

You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file. 

 

In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match. 

 

.. note::

   

  By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the ``SimilarityThreshold`` parameter.

   

 

 ``CompareFaces`` also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value.

 

If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, ``CompareFaces`` returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation.

 

If no faces are detected in the source or target images, ``CompareFaces`` returns an ``InvalidParameterException`` error. 

 

.. note::

   

  This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.

   

 

For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

 

This operation requires permissions to perform the ``rekognition:CompareFaces`` action.

Options

``--source-image`` (structure)


  The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes is not supported. 

  

  To specify a local file use ``--source-image-bytes`` instead.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Bytes=blob,S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "Bytes": blob,
    "S3Object": {
      "Bucket": "string",
      "Name": "string",
      "Version": "string"
    }
  }



``--target-image`` (structure)


  The target image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes is not supported. 

  

  To specify a local file use ``--target-image-bytes`` instead.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Bytes=blob,S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

    "Bytes": blob,
    "S3Object": {
      "Bucket": "string",
      "Name": "string",
      "Version": "string"
    }
  }



``--similarity-threshold`` (float)


  The minimum level of confidence in the face matches that a match must meet to be included in the ``FaceMatches`` array.

  

``--source-image-bytes`` (blob)


  The content of the image to be uploaded. To specify the content of a local file use the fileb:// prefix. Example: fileb://image.png

  

``--target-image-bytes`` (blob)


  The content of the image to be uploaded. To specify the content of a local file use the fileb:// prefix. Example: fileb://image.png

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

SourceImageOrientationCorrection -> (string)

  

  The orientation of the source image (counterclockwise direction). If your application displays the source image, you can use this value to correct image orientation. The bounding box coordinates returned in ``SourceImageFace`` represent the location of the face before the image orientation is corrected. 

   

  .. note::

     

    If the source image is in .jpeg format, it might contain exchangeable image (Exif) metadata that includes the image's orientation. If the Exif metadata for the source image populates the orientation field, the value of ``OrientationCorrection`` is null. The ``SourceImageFace`` bounding box coordinates represent the location of the face after Exif metadata is used to correct the orientation. Images in .png format don't contain Exif metadata.

     

  

  

TargetImageOrientationCorrection -> (string)

  

  The orientation of the target image (in counterclockwise direction). If your application displays the target image, you can use this value to correct the orientation of the image. The bounding box coordinates returned in ``FaceMatches`` and ``UnmatchedFaces`` represent face locations before the image orientation is corrected. 

   

  .. note::

     

    If the target image is in .jpg format, it might contain Exif metadata that includes the orientation of the image. If the Exif metadata for the target image populates the orientation field, the value of ``OrientationCorrection`` is null. The bounding box coordinates in ``FaceMatches`` and ``UnmatchedFaces`` represent the location of the face after Exif metadata is used to correct the orientation. Images in .png format don't contain Exif metadata.
