Description
===========



Gets the label detection results of a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by . 

 

The label detection operation is started by a call to which returns a job identifier (``JobId`` ). When the label detection operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to ``StartlabelDetection`` . To get the results of the label detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is ``SUCCEEDED`` . If so, call and pass the job identifier (``JobId`` ) from the initial call to ``StartLabelDetection`` .

 

 ``GetLabelDetection`` returns an array of detected labels (``Labels`` ) sorted by the time the labels were detected. You can also sort by the label name by specifying ``NAME`` for the ``SortBy`` input parameter.

 

The labels returned include the label name, the percentage confidence in the accuracy of the detected label, and the time the label was detected in the video.

 

Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned. If there are more results than specified in ``MaxResults`` , the value of ``NextToken`` in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call ``GetlabelDetection`` and populate the ``NextToken`` request parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to ``GetLabelDetection`` .

=======
Options
=======

``--job-id`` (string)


  Job identifier for the label detection operation for which you want results returned. You get the job identifer from an initial call to ``StartlabelDetection`` .

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Maximum number of results to return per paginated call. The largest value you can specify is 1000. If you specify a value greater than 1000, a maximum of 1000 results is returned. The default value is 1000.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  If the previous response was incomplete (because there are more labels to retrieve), Amazon Rekognition Video returns a pagination token in the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set of labels. 

  

``--sort-by`` (string)


  Sort to use for elements in the ``Labels`` array. Use ``TIMESTAMP`` to sort array elements by the time labels are detected. Use ``NAME`` to alphabetically group elements for a label together. Within each label group, the array element are sorted by detection confidence. The default sort is by ``TIMESTAMP`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``NAME``

  
  *   ``TIMESTAMP``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output
======

JobStatus -> (string)

  

  The current status of the label detection job.

  

  

StatusMessage -> (string)

  

  If the job fails, ``StatusMessage`` provides a descriptive error message.

  

  

VideoMetadata -> (structure)

  

  Information about a video that Amazon Rekognition Video analyzed. ``Videometadata`` is returned in every page of paginated responses from a Amazon Rekognition video operation.

  

  Codec -> (string)

    

    Type of compression used in the analyzed video. 

    

    

  DurationMillis -> (long)

    

    Length of the video in milliseconds.

    

    

  Format -> (string)

    

    Format of the analyzed video. Possible values are MP4, MOV and AVI. 

    

    

  FrameRate -> (float)

    

    Number of frames per second in the video.

    

    

  FrameHeight -> (long)

    

    Vertical pixel dimension of the video.

    

    

  FrameWidth -> (long)

    

    Horizontal pixel dimension of the video.

    

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  If the response is truncated, Amazon Rekognition Video returns this token that you can use in the subsequent request to retrieve the next set of labels.

  

  

Labels -> (list)

  

  An array of labels detected in the video. Each element contains the detected label and the time, in milliseconds from the start of the video, that the label was detected. 

  

  (structure)

    

    Information about a label detected in a video analysis request and the time the label was detected in the video. 

    

    Timestamp -> (long)

      

      Time, in milliseconds from the start of the video, that the label was detected.

      

      

    Label -> (structure)

      

      Details about the detected label.

      

      Name -> (string)

        

        The name (label) of the object.
