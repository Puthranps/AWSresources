Description

Provides information about a stream processor created by . You can get information about the input and output streams, the input parameters for the face recognition being performed, and the current status of the stream processor.

Options

``--name`` (string)


  Name of the stream processor for which you want information.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

Name -> (string)

  

  Name of the stream processor. 

  

  

StreamProcessorArn -> (string)

  

  ARN of the stream processor.

  

  

Status -> (string)

  

  Current status of the stream processor.

  

  

StatusMessage -> (string)

  

  Detailed status message about the stream processor.

  

  

CreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)

  

  Date and time the stream processor was created

  

  

LastUpdateTimestamp -> (timestamp)

  

  The time, in Unix format, the stream processor was last updated. For example, when the stream processor moves from a running state to a failed state, or when the user starts or stops the stream processor.

  

  

Input -> (structure)

  

  Kinesis video stream that provides the source streaming video.

  

  KinesisVideoStream -> (structure)

    

    The Kinesis video stream input stream for the source streaming video.

    

    Arn -> (string)

      

      ARN of the Kinesis video stream stream that streams the source video.

      

      

    

  

Output -> (structure)

  

  Kinesis data stream to which Amazon Rekognition Video puts the analysis results.

  

  KinesisDataStream -> (structure)

    

    The Amazon Kinesis Data Streams stream to which the Amazon Rekognition stream processor streams the analysis results.

    

    Arn -> (string)

      

      ARN of the output Amazon Kinesis Data Streams stream.

      

      

    

  

RoleArn -> (string)

  

  ARN of the IAM role that allows access to the stream processor.

  

  

Settings -> (structure)

  

  Face recognition input parameters that are being used by the stream processor. Includes the collection to use for face recognition and the face attributes to detect.

  

  FaceSearch -> (structure)

    

    Face search settings to use on a streaming video. 

    

    CollectionId -> (string)

      

      The ID of a collection that contains faces that you want to search for.

      

      

    FaceMatchThreshold -> (float)

      

      Minimum face match confidence score that must be met to return a result for a recognized face. Default is 70. 0 is the lowest confidence. 100 is the highest confidence.
