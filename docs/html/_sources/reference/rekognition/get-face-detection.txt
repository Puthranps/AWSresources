Description
===========



Gets face detection results for a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by .

 

Face detection with Amazon Rekognition Video is an asynchronous operation. You start face detection by calling which returns a job identifier (``JobId`` ). When the face detection operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to ``StartFaceDetection`` . To get the results of the face detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is ``SUCCEEDED`` . If so, call and pass the job identifier (``JobId`` ) from the initial call to ``StartFaceDetection`` .

 

 ``GetFaceDetection`` returns an array of detected faces (``Faces`` ) sorted by the time the faces were detected. 

 

Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned. If there are more results than specified in ``MaxResults`` , the value of ``NextToken`` in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call ``GetFaceDetection`` and populate the ``NextToken`` request parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to ``GetFaceDetection`` .

=======
Options
=======

``--job-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for the face detection job. The ``JobId`` is returned from ``StartFaceDetection`` .

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Maximum number of results to return per paginated call. The largest value you can specify is 1000. If you specify a value greater than 1000, a maximum of 1000 results is returned. The default value is 1000.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  If the previous response was incomplete (because there are more faces to retrieve), Amazon Rekognition Video returns a pagination token in the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set of faces.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
