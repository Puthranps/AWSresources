===========
Description
===========



Detects explicit or suggestive adult content in a specified JPEG or PNG format image. Use ``DetectModerationLabels`` to moderate images depending on your requirements. For example, you might want to filter images that contain nudity, but not images containing suggestive content.

 

To filter images, use the labels returned by ``DetectModerationLabels`` to determine which types of content are appropriate.

 

For information about moderation labels, see Detecting Unsafe Content in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

 

You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.

=======
Options
=======

``--image`` (structure)


  The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes is not supported. 

  

  To specify a local file use ``--image-bytes`` instead.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Bytes=blob,S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "Bytes": blob,
    "S3Object": {
      "Bucket": "string",
      "Name": "string",
      "Version": "string"
    }
  }



``--min-confidence`` (float)


  Specifies the minimum confidence level for the labels to return. Amazon Rekognition doesn't return any labels with a confidence level lower than this specified value.

   

  If you don't specify ``MinConfidence`` , the operation returns labels with confidence values greater than or equal to 50 percent.

  

``--image-bytes`` (blob)


  The content of the image to be uploaded. To specify the content of a local file use the fileb:// prefix. Example: fileb://image.png

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

ModerationLabels -> (list)

  

  Array of detected Moderation labels and the time, in millseconds from the start of the video, they were detected.

  

  (structure)

    

    Provides information about a single type of moderated content found in an image or video. Each type of moderated content has a label within a hierarchical taxonomy. For more information, see Detecting Unsafe Content in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

    

    Confidence -> (float)

      

      Specifies the confidence that Amazon Rekognition has that the label has been correctly identified.

       

      If you don't specify the ``MinConfidence`` parameter in the call to ``DetectModerationLabels`` , the operation returns labels with a confidence value greater than or equal to 50 percent.

      

      

    Name -> (string)

      

      The label name for the type of content detected in the image.

      

      

    ParentName -> (string)

      

      The name for the parent label. Labels at the top level of the hierarchy have the parent label ``""`` .
