Description
===========



Gets the content moderation analysis results for a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by .

 

Content moderation analysis of a video is an asynchronous operation. You start analysis by calling . which returns a job identifier (``JobId`` ). When analysis finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to ``StartContentModeration`` . To get the results of the content moderation analysis, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is ``SUCCEEDED`` . If so, call ``GetCelebrityDetection`` and pass the job identifier (``JobId`` ) from the initial call to ``StartCelebrityDetection`` . 

 

For more information, see Working with Stored Videos in the Amazon Rekognition Devlopers Guide.

 

 ``GetContentModeration`` returns detected content moderation labels, and the time they are detected, in an array, ``ModerationLabels`` , of objects. 

 

By default, the moderated labels are returned sorted by time, in milliseconds from the start of the video. You can also sort them by moderated label by specifying ``NAME`` for the ``SortBy`` input parameter. 

 

Since video analysis can return a large number of results, use the ``MaxResults`` parameter to limit the number of labels returned in a single call to ``GetContentModeration`` . If there are more results than specified in ``MaxResults`` , the value of ``NextToken`` in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call ``GetContentModeration`` and populate the ``NextToken`` request parameter with the value of ``NextToken`` returned from the previous call to ``GetContentModeration`` .

=======
Options
=======

``--job-id`` (string)


  The identifier for the content moderation job. Use ``JobId`` to identify the job in a subsequent call to ``GetContentModeration`` .

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Maximum number of results to return per paginated call. The largest value you can specify is 1000. If you specify a value greater than 1000, a maximum of 1000 results is returned. The default value is 1000.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more data to retrieve), Amazon Rekognition returns a pagination token in the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set of content moderation labels.

  

``--sort-by`` (string)


  Sort to use for elements in the ``ModerationLabelDetections`` array. Use ``TIMESTAMP`` to sort array elements by the time labels are detected. Use ``NAME`` to alphabetically group elements for a label together. Within each label group, the array element are sorted by detection confidence. The default sort is by ``TIMESTAMP`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``NAME``

  
  *   ``TIMESTAMP``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

JobStatus -> (string)

  

  The current status of the content moderation job.

  

  

StatusMessage -> (string)

  

  If the job fails, ``StatusMessage`` provides a descriptive error message.

  

  

VideoMetadata -> (structure)

  

  Information about a video that Amazon Rekognition analyzed. ``Videometadata`` is returned in every page of paginated responses from ``GetContentModeration`` . 

  

  Codec -> (string)

    

    Type of compression used in the analyzed video. 

    

    

  DurationMillis -> (long)

    

    Length of the video in milliseconds.

    

    

  Format -> (string)

    

    Format of the analyzed video. Possible values are MP4, MOV and AVI. 

    

    

  FrameRate -> (float)

    

    Number of frames per second in the video.

    

    

  FrameHeight -> (long)

    

    Vertical pixel dimension of the video.

    

    

  FrameWidth -> (long)

    

    Horizontal pixel dimension of the video.

    

    

  

ModerationLabels -> (list)

  

  The detected moderation labels and the time(s) they were detected.

  

  (structure)

    

    Information about a moderation label detection in a stored video.

    

    Timestamp -> (long)

      

      Time, in milliseconds from the beginning of the video, that the moderation label was detected.

      

      

    ModerationLabel -> (structure)

      

      The moderation label detected by in the stored video.

      

      Confidence -> (float)

        

        Specifies the confidence that Amazon Rekognition has that the label has been correctly identified.

         

        If you don't specify the ``MinConfidence`` parameter in the call to ``DetectModerationLabels`` , the operation returns labels with a confidence value greater than or equal to 50 percent.

        

        

      Name -> (string)

        

        The label name for the type of content detected in the image.

        

        

      ParentName -> (string)

NextToken -> (string)

  

  If the response is truncated, Amazon Rekognition Video returns this token that you can use in the subsequent request to retrieve the next set of moderation labels.
