Description
===========



Gets the face search results for Amazon Rekognition Video face search started by . The search returns faces in a collection that match the faces of persons detected in a video. It also includes the time(s) that faces are matched in the video.

 

Face search in a video is an asynchronous operation. You start face search by calling to which returns a job identifier (``JobId`` ). When the search operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to ``StartFaceSearch`` . To get the search results, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is ``SUCCEEDED`` . If so, call ``GetFaceSearch`` and pass the job identifier (``JobId`` ) from the initial call to ``StartFaceSearch`` .

 

For more information, see Searching Faces in a Collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

 

The search results are retured in an array, ``Persons`` , of objects. Each``PersonMatch`` element contains details about the matching faces in the input collection, person information (facial attributes, bounding boxes, and person identifer) for the matched person, and the time the person was matched in the video.

 

.. note::

   

   ``GetFaceSearch`` only returns the default facial attributes (``BoundingBox`` , ``Confidence`` , ``Landmarks`` , ``Pose`` , and ``Quality`` ). The other facial attributes listed in the ``Face`` object of the following response syntax are not returned. For more information, see FaceDetail in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. 

   

 

By default, the ``Persons`` array is sorted by the time, in milliseconds from the start of the video, persons are matched. You can also sort by persons by specifying ``INDEX`` for the ``SORTBY`` input parameter.

=======
Options
=======

``--job-id`` (string)


  The job identifer for the search request. You get the job identifier from an initial call to ``StartFaceSearch`` .

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Maximum number of results to return per paginated call. The largest value you can specify is 1000. If you specify a value greater than 1000, a maximum of 1000 results is returned. The default value is 1000.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more search results to retrieve), Amazon Rekognition Video returns a pagination token in the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set of search results. 

  

``--sort-by`` (string)


  Sort to use for grouping faces in the response. Use ``TIMESTAMP`` to group faces by the time that they are recognized. Use ``INDEX`` to sort by recognized faces. 

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``INDEX``

  
  *   ``TIMESTAMP``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
