        AudioSourceName -> (string)

          Specifies which audio data to use from each input. In the simplest case, specify an "Audio Selector":#inputs-audio_selector by name based on its order within each input. For example if you specify "Audio Selector 3", then the third audio selector will be used from each input. If an input does not have an "Audio Selector 3", then the audio selector marked as "default" in that input will be used. If there is no audio selector marked as "default", silence will be inserted for the duration of that input. Alternatively, an "Audio Selector Group":#inputs-audio_selector_group name may be specified, with similar default/silence behavior. If no audio_source_name is specified, then "Audio Selector 1" will be chosen automatically.

          

        AudioType -> (integer)

          Applies only if Follow Input Audio Type is unchecked (false). A number between 0 and 255. The following are defined in ISO-IEC 13818-1: 0 = Undefined, 1 = Clean Effects, 2 = Hearing Impaired, 3 = Visually Impaired Commentary, 4-255 = Reserved.

          

        AudioTypeControl -> (string)

          When set to FOLLOW_INPUT, if the input contains an ISO 639 audio_type, then that value is passed through to the output. If the input contains no ISO 639 audio_type, the value in Audio Type is included in the output. Otherwise the value in Audio Type is included in the output. Note that this field and audioType are both ignored if audioDescriptionBroadcasterMix is set to BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD.

          

        CodecSettings -> (structure)

          Audio codec settings (CodecSettings) under (AudioDescriptions) contains the group of settings related to audio encoding. The settings in this group vary depending on the value you choose for Audio codec (Codec). For each codec enum you choose, define the corresponding settings object. The following lists the codec enum, settings object pairs. * AAC, AacSettings * MP2, Mp2Settings * WAV, WavSettings * AIFF, AiffSettings * AC3, Ac3Settings * EAC3, Eac3Settings

          AacSettings -> (structure)

            Required when you set (Codec) under (AudioDescriptions)>(CodecSettings) to the value AAC. The service accepts one of two mutually exclusive groups of AAC settings--VBR and CBR. To select one of these modes, set the value of Bitrate control mode (rateControlMode) to "VBR" or "CBR". In VBR mode, you control the audio quality with the setting VBR quality (vbrQuality). In CBR mode, you use the setting Bitrate (bitrate). Defaults and valid values depend on the rate control mode.

            AudioDescriptionBroadcasterMix -> (string)

              Choose BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD when the input contains pre-mixed main audio + audio description (AD) as a stereo pair. The value for AudioType will be set to 3, which signals to downstream systems that this stream contains "broadcaster mixed AD". Note that the input received by the encoder must contain pre-mixed audio; the encoder does not perform the mixing. When you choose BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD, the encoder ignores any values you provide in AudioType and FollowInputAudioType. Choose NORMAL when the input does not contain pre-mixed audio + audio description (AD). In this case, the encoder will use any values you provide for AudioType and FollowInputAudioType.

              

            Bitrate -> (integer)

              Average bitrate in bits/second. Defaults and valid values depend on rate control mode and profile.

              AAC Profile.

              

            CodingMode -> (string)

              Mono (Audio Description), Mono, Stereo, or 5.1 channel layout. Valid values depend on rate control mode and profile. "1.0 - Audio Description (Receiver Mix)" setting receives a stereo description plus control track and emits a mono AAC encode of the description track, with control data emitted in the PES header as per ETSI TS 101 154 Annex E.

              

            RateControlMode -> (string)

              Rate Control Mode.

        SegmentationStyle -> (string)

          The segmentation style parameter controls how segmentation markers are inserted into the transport stream. With avails, it is possible that segments may be truncated, which can influence where future segmentation markers are inserted.

This means the subsequent segment will have a duration of of $segmentation_time seconds. When a segmentation style of "maintain_cadence" is selected and a segment is truncated due to an avail, we will not reset the segmentation cadence. This means the subsequent segment will likely be truncated as well. However, all segments after that will have a duration of $segmentation_time seconds. Note that EBP lookahead is a slight exception to this rule.

          FramerateNumerator -> (integer)

            Frame capture will encode the first frame of the output stream, then one frame every framerateDenominator/framerateNumerator seconds. For example, settings of framerateNumerator = 1 and framerateDenominator = 3 (a rate of 1/3 frame per second) will capture the first frame, then 1 frame every 3s.

          FramerateControl -> (string)

            If you are using the console, use the Framerate setting to specify the framerate for this output. If you want to keep the same framerate as the input video, choose Follow source. If you want to do framerate conversion, choose a framerate from the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates shown in the dropdown list are decimal approximations of fractions. If you choose Custom, specify your framerate as a fraction. If you are creating your transcoding job specification as a JSON file without the console, use FramerateControl to specify which value the service uses for the framerate for this output. Choose INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to use the framerate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you want the service to use the framerate you specify in the settings FramerateNumerator and FramerateDenominator.

            

          FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)

            When set to INTERPOLATE, produces smoother motion during framerate conversion.

            

          FramerateDenominator -> (integer)

Use FramerateDenominator to specify the denominator of this fraction. In this example, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenominator. When you use the console for transcode jobs that use framerate conversion, provide the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

            

          FramerateNumerator -> (integer)

            Framerate numerator - framerate is a fraction, e.g. 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.

            

          GopBReference -> (string)

          GopClosedCadence -> (integer)

            Frequency of closed GOPs. In streaming applications, it is recommended that this be set to 1 so a decoder joining mid-stream will receive an IDR frame as quickly as possible. Setting this value to 0 will break output segmenting.

            

          GopSize -> (double)

            GOP Length (keyframe interval) in frames or seconds. Must be greater than zero.

            Use Interlace mode (InterlaceMode) to choose the scan line type for the output. * Top Field First (TOP_FIELD) and Bottom Field First (BOTTOM_FIELD) produce interlaced output with the entire output having the same field polarity (top or bottom first). * Follow, Default Top (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD) and Follow, Default Bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) use the same field polarity as the source. Therefore, behavior depends on the input scan type, as follows. - If the source is interlaced, the output will be interlaced with the same polarity as the source (it will follow the source). The output could therefore be a mix of "top field first" and "bottom field first". - If the source is progressive, the output will be interlaced with "top field first" or "bottom field first" polarity, depending on which of the Follow options you chose.

            

          MaxBitrate -> (integer)

            Maximum bitrate in bits/second. For example, enter five megabits per second as 5000000. Required when Rate control mode is QVBR.

          ParControl -> (string)

            Using the API, enable ParFollowSource if you want the service to use the pixel aspect ratio from the input. Using the console, do this by choosing Follow source for Pixel aspect ratio.

            

          ParDenominator -> (integer)

            Pixel Aspect Ratio denominator.

            Settings for quality-defined variable bitrate encoding with the H.264 codec. Required when you set Rate control mode to QVBR. Not valid when you set Rate control mode to a value other than QVBR, or when you don't define Rate control mode.

            MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)

              Use this setting only when Rate control mode is QVBR and Quality tuning level is Multi-pass HQ. For Max average bitrate values suited to the complexity of your input video, the service limits the average bitrate of the video part of this output to the value you choose. That is, the total size of the video element is less than or equal to the value you set multiplied by the number of seconds of encoded output.

              

            QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)

              Required when you use QVBR rate control mode. That is, when you specify qvbrSettings within h264Settings. Specify the target quality level for this output, from 1 to 10.

Therefore, behavior depends on the input scan type. - If the source is interlaced, the output will be interlaced with the same polarity as the source (it will follow the source). The output could therefore be a mix of "top field first" and "bottom field first". - If the source is progressive, the output will be interlaced with "top field first" or "bottom field first" polarity, depending on which of the Follow options you chose.

              Use this setting only when Rate control mode is QVBR and Quality tuning level is Multi-pass HQ. For Max average bitrate values suited to the complexity of your input video, the service limits the average bitrate of the video part of this output to the value you choose. That is, the total size of the video element is less than or equal to the value you set multiplied by the number of seconds of encoded output.

Up to 3 layers are supported depending on GOP structure: I- and P-frames form one layer, reference B-frames can form a second layer and non-reference b-frames can form a third layer. Decoders can optionally decode only the lower temporal layers to generate a lower frame rate output. For example, given a bitstream with temporal IDs and with b-frames = 1 (i.e. IbPbPb display order), a decoder could decode all the frames for full frame rate output or only the I and P frames (lowest temporal layer) for a half frame rate output.

      FixedAfd -> (integer)

        Applies only if you set AFD Signaling(AfdSignaling) to Fixed (FIXED). Use Fixed (FixedAfd) to specify a four-bit AFD value which the service will write on all frames of this video output.

        

      Height -> (integer)

        Use the Height (Height) setting to define the video resolution height for this output. Specify in pixels. If you don't provide a value here, the service will use the input height.

      RespondToAfd -> (string)

        Use Respond to AFD (RespondToAfd) to specify how the service changes the video itself in response to AFD values in the input. * Choose Respond to clip the input video frame according to the AFD value, input display aspect ratio, and output display aspect ratio. * Choose Passthrough to include the input AFD values. Do not choose this when AfdSignaling is set to (NONE). A preferred implementation of this workflow is to set RespondToAfd to (NONE) and set AfdSignaling to (AUTO). * Choose None to remove all input AFD values from this output.

        

      ScalingBehavior -> (string)

        Applies only if your input aspect ratio is different from your output aspect ratio. Enable Stretch to output (StretchToOutput) to have the service stretch your video image to fit.

      TimecodeInsertion -> (string)

        Applies only to H.264, H.265, MPEG2, and ProRes outputs. Only enable Timecode insertion when the input framerate is identical to the output framerate. To include timecodes in this output, set Timecode insertion (VideoTimecodeInsertion) to PIC_TIMING_SEI. To leave them out, set it to DISABLED. Default is DISABLED. When the service inserts timecodes in an output, by default, it uses any embedded timecodes from the input. If none are present, the service will set the timecode for the first output frame to zero. To change this default behavior, adjust the settings under Timecode configuration (TimecodeConfig). In the console, these settings are located under Job > Job settings > Timecode configuration. Note - Timecode source under input settings (InputTimecodeSource) does not affect the timecodes that are inserted in the output. Source under Job settings > Timecode configuration (TimecodeSource) does.

        

      VideoPreprocessors -> (structure)

        Find additional transcoding features under Preprocessors (VideoPreprocessors). Enable the features at each output individually. These features are disabled by default.

            Only applies when you set Deinterlacer (DeinterlaceMode) to Deinterlace (DEINTERLACE) or Adaptive (ADAPTIVE). Motion adaptive interpolate (INTERPOLATE) produces sharper pictures, while blend (BLEND) produces smoother motion. Use (INTERPOLATE_TICKER) OR (BLEND_TICKER) if your source file includes a ticker, such as a scrolling headline at the bottom of the frame.

            

          Control -> (string)

            - When set to NORMAL (default), the deinterlacer does not convert frames that are tagged in metadata as progressive. It will only convert those that are tagged as some other type. - When set to FORCE_ALL_FRAMES, the deinterlacer converts every frame to progressive - even those that are already tagged as progressive. Turn Force mode on only if there is a good chance that the metadata has tagged frames as progressive when they are not progressive. Do not turn on otherwise; processing frames that are already progressive into progressive will probably result in lower quality video.

            

          Mode -> (string)

            Use Deinterlacer (DeinterlaceMode) to choose how the service will do deinterlacing. Default is Deinterlace. - Deinterlace converts interlaced to progressive. - Inverse telecine converts Hard Telecine 29.97i to progressive 23.976p. - Adaptive auto-detects and converts to progressive.
