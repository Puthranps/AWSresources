list-queues

===========
Description
===========

Retrieve a JSON array of up to twenty of your queues. This will return the queues themselves, not just a list of them. To retrieve the next twenty queues, use the nextToken string returned with the array.

See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/mediaconvert-2017-08-29/ListQueues>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``list-queues`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Queues``

  [--list-by <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--list-by`` (string)
Optional. When you request a list of queues, you can choose to list them alphabetically by NAME or chronologically by CREATION_DATE. If you don't specify, the service will list them by creation date.

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``NAME``

  
  *   ``CREATION_DATE``

  

  

``--order`` (string)
When you request lists of resources, you can optionally specify whether they are sorted in ASCENDING or DESCENDING order. Default varies by resource.

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``ASCENDING``

  
  *   ``DESCENDING``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

NextToken -> (string)

  Use this string to request the next batch of queues.

  

Queues -> (list)

  List of queues.

  (structure)

    You can use queues to manage the resources that are available to your AWS account for running multiple transcoding jobs at the same time. If you don't specify a queue, the service sends all jobs through the default queue. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/about-resource-allocation-and-job-prioritization.html.

    Arn -> (string)

      An identifier for this resource that is unique within all of AWS.

      

    CreatedAt -> (timestamp)

      The time stamp in epoch seconds for queue creation.

      

    Description -> (string)

      An optional description that you create for each queue.

      

    LastUpdated -> (timestamp)

      The time stamp in epoch seconds when the queue was last updated.

      

    Name -> (string)

      A name that you create for each queue. Each name must be unique within your account.

      

    PricingPlan -> (string)

      Specifies whether the pricing plan for the queue is On-demand or Reserved. The pricing plan for the queue determines whether you pay On-demand or Reserved pricing for the transcoding jobs that you run through the queue. For Reserved queue pricing, you must set up a contract. You can create a Reserved queue contract through the AWS Elemental MediaConvert console.

      

    ProgressingJobsCount -> (integer)

      The estimated number of jobs with a PROGRESSING status.

      

    ReservationPlan -> (structure)

      Details about the pricing plan for your reserved queue. Required for reserved queues and not applicable to on-demand queues.

      Commitment -> (string)

        The length of time that you commit to when you set up a pricing plan contract for a reserved queue.

        

      ExpiresAt -> (timestamp)

        The time stamp, in epoch seconds, for when the pricing plan for this reserved queue expires.

        

      PurchasedAt -> (timestamp)

        The time stamp in epoch seconds when the reserved queue's reservation plan was created.

        

      RenewalType -> (string)

        Specifies whether the pricing plan contract for your reserved queue automatically renews (AUTO_RENEW) or expires (EXPIRE) at the end of the contract period.

        

      ReservedSlots -> (integer)

        Specifies the number of reserved transcode slots (RTSs) for this queue. The number of RTS determines how many jobs the queue can process in parallel; each RTS can process one job at a time. To increase this number, create a replacement contract through the AWS Elemental MediaConvert console.

        

      Status -> (string)

        Specifies whether the pricing plan for your reserved queue is ACTIVE or EXPIRED.

        

      

    Status -> (string)

      Queues can be ACTIVE or PAUSED. If you pause a queue, the service won't begin processing jobs in that queue. Jobs that are running when you pause the queue continue to run until they finish or result in an error.

      

    SubmittedJobsCount -> (integer)

      The estimated number of jobs with a SUBMITTED status.

      

    Type -> (string)

      Specifies whether this queue is system or custom. System queues are built in. You can't modify or delete system queues. You can create and modify custom queues.
