Options
=======

``--name`` (string)
The name of the queue that you want information about.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output
======

Queue -> (structure)

  You can use queues to manage the resources that are available to your AWS account for running multiple transcoding jobs at the same time. If you don't specify a queue, the service sends all jobs through the default queue. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/about-resource-allocation-and-job-prioritization.html.

  Arn -> (string)

    An identifier for this resource that is unique within all of AWS.

    

  CreatedAt -> (timestamp)

    The time stamp in epoch seconds for queue creation.

    

  Description -> (string)

    An optional description that you create for each queue.

    

  LastUpdated -> (timestamp)

    The time stamp in epoch seconds when the queue was last updated.

    

  Name -> (string)

    A name that you create for each queue. Each name must be unique within your account.

    

  PricingPlan -> (string)

    Specifies whether the pricing plan for the queue is On-demand or Reserved. The pricing plan for the queue determines whether you pay On-demand or Reserved pricing for the transcoding jobs that you run through the queue. For Reserved queue pricing, you must set up a contract. You can create a Reserved queue contract through the AWS Elemental MediaConvert console.

    

  ProgressingJobsCount -> (integer)

    The estimated number of jobs with a PROGRESSING status.

    

  ReservationPlan -> (structure)

    Details about the pricing plan for your reserved queue. Required for reserved queues and not applicable to on-demand queues.

    Commitment -> (string)

      The length of time that you commit to when you set up a pricing plan contract for a reserved queue.

      

    ExpiresAt -> (timestamp)

      The time stamp, in epoch seconds, for when the pricing plan for this reserved queue expires.

      

    PurchasedAt -> (timestamp)

      The time stamp in epoch seconds when the reserved queue's reservation plan was created.

      

    RenewalType -> (string)

      Specifies whether the pricing plan contract for your reserved queue automatically renews (AUTO_RENEW) or expires (EXPIRE) at the end of the contract period.

      

    ReservedSlots -> (integer)

      Specifies the number of reserved transcode slots (RTSs) for this queue. The number of RTS determines how many jobs the queue can process in parallel; each RTS can process one job at a time. To increase this number, create a replacement contract through the AWS Elemental MediaConvert console.

      

    Status -> (string)

      Specifies whether the pricing plan for your reserved queue is ACTIVE or EXPIRED.

      

    

  Status -> (string)

    Queues can be ACTIVE or PAUSED. If you pause a queue, the service won't begin processing jobs in that queue. Jobs that are running when you pause the queue continue to run until they finish or result in an error.

    

  SubmittedJobsCount -> (integer)

    The estimated number of jobs with a SUBMITTED status.

    

  Type -> (string)

    Specifies whether this queue is system or custom. System queues are built in. You can't modify or delete system queues. You can create and modify custom queues.
