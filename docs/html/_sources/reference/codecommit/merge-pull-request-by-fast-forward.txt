Synopsis
========

::

    merge-pull-request-by-fast-forward
  --pull-request-id <value>
  --repository-name <value>
  [--source-commit-id <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--pull-request-id`` (string)


  The system-generated ID of the pull request. To get this ID, use  ListPullRequests .

  

``--repository-name`` (string)


  The name of the repository where the pull request was created.

  

``--source-commit-id`` (string)


  The full commit ID of the original or updated commit in the pull request source branch. Pass this value if you want an exception thrown if the current commit ID of the tip of the source branch does not match this commit ID.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
