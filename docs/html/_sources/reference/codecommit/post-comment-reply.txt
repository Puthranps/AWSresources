Options
=======

``--in-reply-to`` (string)


  The system-generated ID of the comment to which you want to reply. To get this ID, use  GetCommentsForComparedCommit or  GetCommentsForPullRequest .

  

``--client-request-token`` (string)


  A unique, client-generated idempotency token that when provided in a request, ensures the request cannot be repeated with a changed parameter. If a request is received with the same parameters and a token is included, the request will return information about the initial request that used that token.

  

``--content`` (string)


  The contents of your reply to a comment.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
