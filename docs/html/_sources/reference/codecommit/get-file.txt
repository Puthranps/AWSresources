Synopsis

::

=======
Options
=======

``--repository-name`` (string)


  The name of the repository that contains the file.

  

``--commit-specifier`` (string)


  The fully-quaified reference that identifies the commit that contains the file. For example, you could specify a full commit ID, a tag, a branch name, or a reference such as refs/heads/master. If none is provided, then the head commit will be used.

  

``--file-path`` (string)


  The fully-qualified path to the file, including the full name and extension of the file. For example, /examples/file.md is the fully-qualified path to a file named file.md in a folder named examples.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
