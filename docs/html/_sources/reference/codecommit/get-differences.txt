===========
Description
===========



Returns information about the differences in a valid commit specifier (such as a branch, tag, HEAD, commit ID or other fully qualified reference). Results can be limited to a specified path.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/codecommit-2015-04-13/GetDifferences>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``get-differences`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``differences``

=======
Options
=======

``--repository-name`` (string)


  The name of the repository where you want to get differences.

  

``--before-commit-specifier`` (string)


  The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to identify a commit. For example, the full commit ID. Optional. If not specified, all changes prior to the ``afterCommitSpecifier`` value will be shown. If you do not use ``beforeCommitSpecifier`` in your request, consider limiting the results with ``maxResults`` .

  

``--after-commit-specifier`` (string)


  The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to identify a commit.

  

``--before-path`` (string)


  The file path in which to check for differences. Limits the results to this path. Can also be used to specify the previous name of a directory or folder. If ``beforePath`` and ``afterPath`` are not specified, differences will be shown for all paths.

  

``--after-path`` (string)


  The file path in which to check differences. Limits the results to this path. Can also be used to specify the changed name of a directory or folder, if it has changed. If not specified, differences will be shown for all paths.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

========
Examples
========

**To get information about differences for a commit specifier in a repository**

This example shows view metadata information about changes between two commit specifiers (branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified references, such as commit IDs) in a renamed folder in AWS CodeCommit repository named MyDemoRepo. The example includes several options that are not required, including --before-commit-specifier, --before-path, and --after-path, in order to more fully illustrate how you can use these options to limit the results. The response includes file mode permissions. 

Command::

  aws codecommit get-differences --repository-name MyDemoRepo --before-commit-specifier 955bba12thisisanexamplethisisanexample --after-commit-specifier 14a95463thisisanexamplethisisanexample --before-path tmp/example-folder --after-path tmp/renamed-folder

Output::

  {
    "differences": [
        {
            "afterBlob": {
                "path": "blob.txt",
                "blobId": "2eb4af3b1thisisanexamplethisisanexample1",
                "mode": "100644"
            },
            "changeType": "M",
            "beforeBlob": {
                "path": "blob.txt",
                "blobId": "bf7fcf281thisisanexamplethisisanexample1",
                "mode": "100644"
            }
        }
    ]
  }
