Synopsis

::

    update-pull-request-status
  --pull-request-id <value>
  --pull-request-status <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--pull-request-id`` (string)


  The system-generated ID of the pull request. To get this ID, use  ListPullRequests .

  

``--pull-request-status`` (string)


  The status of the pull request. The only valid operations are to update the status from ``OPEN`` to ``OPEN`` , ``OPEN`` to ``CLOSED`` or from from ``CLOSED`` to ``CLOSED`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``OPEN``

  
  *   ``CLOSED``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
