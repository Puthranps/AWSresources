Description
===========



Returns information about merge conflicts between the before and after commit IDs for a pull request in a repository.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis
========

::

    get-merge-conflicts
  --repository-name <value>
  --destination-commit-specifier <value>
  --source-commit-specifier <value>
  --merge-option <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--repository-name`` (string)


  The name of the repository where the pull request was created.

  

``--destination-commit-specifier`` (string)


  The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to identify a commit. For example, a branch name or a full commit ID.

  

``--source-commit-specifier`` (string)


  The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to identify a commit. For example, a branch name or a full commit ID.

  

``--merge-option`` (string)


  The merge option or strategy you want to use to merge the code. The only valid value is FAST_FORWARD_MERGE.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``FAST_FORWARD_MERGE``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


========
Examples
========

**To view whether there are any merge conflicts for a pull request**

This example demonstrates how to view whether there are any merge conflicts between the tip of a source branch named 'my-feature-branch' and a destination branch named 'master' in a repository named 'MyDemoRepo'::

Command::

  aws codecommit get-merge-conflicts --repository-name MyDemoRepo --source-commit-specifier my-feature-branch --destination-commit-specifier master --merge-option FAST_FORWARD_MERGE

Output::

  {
    "destinationCommitId": "fac04518EXAMPLE",
    "mergeable": false,
    "sourceCommitId": "16d097f03EXAMPLE"
  }

======
Output
======

mergeable -> (boolean)

  

  A Boolean value that indicates whether the code is mergable by the specified merge option.

  

  

destinationCommitId -> (string)

  

  The commit ID of the destination commit specifier that was used in the merge evaluation.

  

  

sourceCommitId -> (string)

  

  The commit ID of the source commit specifier that was used in the merge evaluation.
