Synopsis

::

    create-pull-request
  --title <value>
  [--description <value>]
  --targets <value>
  [--client-request-token <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--title`` (string)


  The title of the pull request. This title will be used to identify the pull request to other users in the repository.

  

``--description`` (string)


  A description of the pull request.

  

``--targets`` (list)


  The targets for the pull request, including the source of the code to be reviewed (the source branch), and the destination where the creator of the pull request intends the code to be merged after the pull request is closed (the destination branch).

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    repositoryName=string,sourceReference=string,destinationReference=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "repositoryName": "string",
      "sourceReference": "string",
      "destinationReference": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--client-request-token`` (string)


  A unique, client-generated idempotency token that when provided in a request, ensures the request cannot be repeated with a changed parameter. If a request is received with the same parameters and a token is included, the request will return information about the initial request that used that token.

   

  .. note::

     

    The AWS SDKs prepopulate client request tokens. If using an AWS SDK, you do not have to generate an idempotency token, as this will be done for you.

     

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples

**To create a pull request**

This example demonstrates how to create a pull request named 'My Pull Request' with a description of 'Please review these changes by Tuesday' that targets the 'MyNewBranch' source branch and is to be merged to the default branch 'master' in an AWS CodeCommit repository named 'MyDemoRepo'::


Command::

  aws codecommit create-pull-request --title "My Pull Request" --description "Please review these changes by Tuesday" --client-request-token 123Example --targets repositoryName=MyDemoRepo,sourceReference=MyNewBranch 

Output::

  {
    "pullRequest": { 
      "authorArn": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:user/Jane_Doe",
      "clientRequestToken": "123Example",
      "creationDate": 1508962823.285,
      "description": "Please review these changes by Tuesday",
      "lastActivityDate": 1508962823.285,
      "pullRequestId": "42",
      "pullRequestStatus": "OPEN",
      "pullRequestTargets": [ 
         { 
            "destinationCommit": "5d036259EXAMPLE",
            "destinationReference": "refs/heads/master",
            "mergeMetadata": { 
               "isMerged": false,
            },
            "repositoryName": "MyDemoRepo",
            "sourceCommit": "317f8570EXAMPLE",
            "sourceReference": "refs/heads/MyNewBranch"
         }
      ],
      "title": "My Pull Request"
