describe-replication-groups
***************************



===========
Description
===========



Returns information about a particular replication group. If no identifier is specified, ``DescribeReplicationGroups`` returns information about all replication groups.

 

.. note::

   

  This operation is valid for Redis only.

   



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/elasticache-2015-02-02/DescribeReplicationGroups>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``describe-replication-groups`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``ReplicationGroups``

=======
Options
=======

``--replication-group-id`` (string)


  The identifier for the replication group to be described. This parameter is not case sensitive.

   

  If you do not specify this parameter, information about all replication groups is returned.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

    SnapshotRetentionLimit -> (integer)

      

      The number of days for which ElastiCache retains automatic cluster snapshots before deleting them. For example, if you set ``SnapshotRetentionLimit`` to 5, a snapshot that was taken today is retained for 5 days before being deleted.

       

      .. warning::

         

        If the value of ``SnapshotRetentionLimit`` is set to zero (0), backups are turned off.

         

      

      

    SnapshotWindow -> (string)

      

      The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache begins taking a daily snapshot of your node group (shard).

       

      Example: ``05:00-09:00``  

       

      If you do not specify this parameter, ElastiCache automatically chooses an appropriate time range.

       

      .. note::

         

        This parameter is only valid if the ``Engine`` parameter is ``redis`` .

      A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to ``true`` .

       

      You cannot modify the value of ``TransitEncryptionEnabled`` after the cluster is created. To enable in-transit encryption on a cluster you must set ``TransitEncryptionEnabled`` to ``true`` when you create a cluster.
