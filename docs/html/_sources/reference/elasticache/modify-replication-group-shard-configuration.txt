``--replication-group-id`` (string)


  The name of the Redis (cluster mode enabled) cluster (replication group) on which the shards are to be configured.

  

``--node-group-count`` (integer)


  The number of node groups (shards) that results from the modification of the shard configuration.

  

``--apply-immediately`` | ``--no-apply-immediately`` (boolean)


  Indicates that the shard reconfiguration process begins immediately. At present, the only permitted value for this parameter is ``true`` .

   

  Value: true

  

``--resharding-configuration`` (list)


  Specifies the preferred availability zones for each node group in the cluster. If the value of ``NodeGroupCount`` is greater than the current number of node groups (shards), you can use this parameter to specify the preferred availability zones of the cluster's shards. If you omit this parameter ElastiCache selects availability zones for you.

   

  You can specify this parameter only if the value of ``NodeGroupCount`` is greater than the current number of node groups (shards).

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    NodeGroupId=string,PreferredAvailabilityZones=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "NodeGroupId": "string",
      "PreferredAvailabilityZones": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--node-groups-to-remove`` (list)


  If the value of ``NodeGroupCount`` is less than the current number of node groups (shards), the ``NodeGroupsToRemove`` or ``NodeGroupsToRetain`` is a required list of node group ids to remove from or retain in the cluster.

   

  ElastiCache for Redis will attempt to remove all node groups listed by ``NodeGroupsToRemove`` from the cluster.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--node-groups-to-retain`` (list)


  If the value of ``NodeGroupCount`` is less than the current number of node groups (shards), the ``NodeGroupsToRemove`` or ``NodeGroupsToRetain`` is a required list of node group ids to remove from or retain in the cluster.

   

  ElastiCache for Redis will attempt to remove all node groups except those listed by ``NodeGroupsToRetain`` from the cluster.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

    If you do not specify this parameter, ElastiCache automatically chooses an appropriate time range.

     

    .. note::

       

      This parameter is only valid if the ``Engine`` parameter is ``redis`` .

       

    

    

  ClusterEnabled -> (boolean)

    

    A flag indicating whether or not this replication group is cluster enabled; i.e., whether its data can be partitioned across multiple shards (API/CLI: node groups).

     

    Valid values: ``true`` | ``false``

  AuthTokenEnabled -> (boolean)

    

    A flag that enables using an ``AuthToken`` (password) when issuing Redis commands.

     

    Default: ``false``  

    

    

  TransitEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)

    

    A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to ``true`` .

     

    You cannot modify the value of ``TransitEncryptionEnabled`` after the cluster is created. To enable in-transit encryption on a cluster you must set ``TransitEncryptionEnabled`` to ``true`` when you create a cluster.

     

     **Required:** Only available when creating a replication group in an Amazon VPC using redis version ``3.2.6`` or ``4.x`` .

     

    Default: ``false``

    You cannot modify the value of ``AtRestEncryptionEnabled`` after the cluster is created. To enable encryption at-rest on a cluster you must set ``AtRestEncryptionEnabled`` to ``true`` when you create a cluster.

     

     **Required:** Only available when creating a replication group in an Amazon VPC using redis version ``3.2.6`` or ``4.x`` .

     

    Default: ``false``
