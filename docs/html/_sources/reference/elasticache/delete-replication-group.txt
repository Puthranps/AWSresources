************************
delete-replication-group
************************



===========
Description
===========



Deletes an existing replication group. By default, this operation deletes the entire replication group, including the primary/primaries and all of the read replicas. If the replication group has only one primary, you can optionally delete only the read replicas, while retaining the primary by setting ``RetainPrimaryCluster=true`` .

 

When you receive a successful response from this operation, Amazon ElastiCache immediately begins deleting the selected resources; you cannot cancel or revert this operation.

 

.. note::

   

  This operation is valid for Redis only.

=======
Options
=======

``--replication-group-id`` (string)


  The identifier for the cluster to be deleted. This parameter is not case sensitive.

  

``--retain-primary-cluster`` | ``--no-retain-primary-cluster`` (boolean)


  If set to ``true`` , all of the read replicas are deleted, but the primary node is retained.

  

``--final-snapshot-identifier`` (string)


  The name of a final node group (shard) snapshot. ElastiCache creates the snapshot from the primary node in the cluster, rather than one of the replicas; this is to ensure that it captures the freshest data. After the final snapshot is taken, the replication group is immediately deleted.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

      * Redis versions earlier than 2.8.6. 
       
      * Redis (cluster mode disabled): T1 and T2 cache node types.

    .. note::

       

      This parameter is only valid if the ``Engine`` parameter is ``redis`` .

       

    

    

  ClusterEnabled -> (boolean)

    A flag that enables using an ``AuthToken`` (password) when issuing Redis commands.

     

    Default: ``false``  

    

    

  TransitEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)

    

    A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to ``true`` .

     

    You cannot modify the value of ``TransitEncryptionEnabled`` after the cluster is created. To enable in-transit encryption on a cluster you must set ``TransitEncryptionEnabled`` to ``true`` when you create a cluster.
