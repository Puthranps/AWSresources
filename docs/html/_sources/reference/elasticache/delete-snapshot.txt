===========
Description
===========



Deletes an existing snapshot. When you receive a successful response from this operation, ElastiCache immediately begins deleting the snapshot; you cannot cancel or revert this operation.

 

.. note::

   

  This operation is valid for Redis only.

Options

``--snapshot-name`` (string)


  The name of the snapshot to be deleted.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Snapshot -> (structure)

  

  Represents a copy of an entire Redis cluster as of the time when the snapshot was taken.

  

  SnapshotName -> (string)

  ReplicationGroupId -> (string)

    

    The unique identifier of the source replication group.

    

    

  ReplicationGroupDescription -> (string)

    

    A description of the source replication group.

    

    

  CacheClusterId -> (string)

    

    The user-supplied identifier of the source cluster.

    

    

  SnapshotStatus -> (string)

    

    The status of the snapshot. Valid values: ``creating`` | ``available`` | ``restoring`` | ``copying`` | ``deleting`` .

    

    

  SnapshotSource -> (string)

    

    Indicates whether the snapshot is from an automatic backup (``automated`` ) or was created manually (``manual`` ).

    

    

  CacheNodeType -> (string)

    

    The name of the compute and memory capacity node type for the source cluster.

     

    The following node types are supported by ElastiCache. Generally speaking, the current generation types provide more memory and computational power at lower cost when compared to their equivalent previous generation counterparts.

     

     
    * General purpose: 

       
      * Current generation:   **T2 node types:**  ``cache.t2.micro`` , ``cache.t2.small`` , ``cache.t2.medium``    **M3 node types:**  ``cache.m3.medium`` , ``cache.m3.large`` , ``cache.m3.xlarge`` , ``cache.m3.2xlarge``    **M4 node types:**  ``cache.m4.large`` , ``cache.m4.xlarge`` , ``cache.m4.2xlarge`` , ``cache.m4.4xlarge`` , ``cache.m4.10xlarge``   
       
      * Previous generation: (not recommended)  **T1 node types:**  ``cache.t1.micro``    **M1 node types:**  ``cache.m1.small`` , ``cache.m1.medium`` , ``cache.m1.large`` , ``cache.m1.xlarge``   
       

     
     
    * Compute optimized: 

       
      * Previous generation: (not recommended)  **C1 node types:**  ``cache.c1.xlarge``   
       

     
     
    * Memory optimized: 

       
      * Current generation:   **R3 node types:**  ``cache.r3.large`` , ``cache.r3.xlarge`` , ``cache.r3.2xlarge`` , ``cache.r3.4xlarge`` , ``cache.r3.8xlarge``    **R4 node types;**  ``cache.r4.large`` , ``cache.r4.xlarge`` , ``cache.r4.2xlarge`` , ``cache.r4.4xlarge`` , ``cache.r4.8xlarge`` , ``cache.r4.16xlarge``   
       
      * Previous generation: (not recommended)  **M2 node types:**  ``cache.m2.xlarge`` , ``cache.m2.2xlarge`` , ``cache.m2.4xlarge``   
       

     
     

     

     **Notes:**  

     

     
    * All T2 instances are created in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). 
     
    * Redis (cluster mode disabled): Redis backup/restore is not supported on T1 and T2 instances.  
     
    * Redis (cluster mode enabled): Backup/restore is not supported on T1 instances. 
     
    * Redis Append-only files (AOF) functionality is not supported for T1 or T2 instances.
