=======
Options
=======

``--cache-cluster-id`` (string)


  The node group (shard) identifier. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

   

   **Constraints:**  

   

   
  * A name must contain from 1 to 20 alphanumeric characters or hyphens. 
   
  * The first character must be a letter. 
   
  * A name cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. 
   

  

``--replication-group-id`` (string)


  The ID of the replication group to which this cluster should belong. If this parameter is specified, the cluster is added to the specified replication group as a read replica; otherwise, the cluster is a standalone primary that is not part of any replication group.

   

  If the specified replication group is Multi-AZ enabled and the Availability Zone is not specified, the cluster is created in Availability Zones that provide the best spread of read replicas across Availability Zones.

   

  .. note::

     

    This parameter is only valid if the ``Engine`` parameter is ``redis`` .

     

  

``--az-mode`` (string)


  Specifies whether the nodes in this Memcached cluster are created in a single Availability Zone or created across multiple Availability Zones in the cluster's region.

   

  This parameter is only supported for Memcached clusters.

   

  If the ``AZMode`` and ``PreferredAvailabilityZones`` are not specified, ElastiCache assumes ``single-az`` mode.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``single-az``

  
  *   ``cross-az``

  

  

``--preferred-availability-zone`` (string)


  The EC2 Availability Zone in which the cluster is created.

   

  All nodes belonging to this Memcached cluster are placed in the preferred Availability Zone. If you want to create your nodes across multiple Availability Zones, use ``PreferredAvailabilityZones`` .

   

  Default: System chosen Availability Zone.

  

``--preferred-availability-zones`` (list)


  A list of the Availability Zones in which cache nodes are created. The order of the zones in the list is not important.

   

  This option is only supported on Memcached.

   

  .. note::

     

    If you are creating your cluster in an Amazon VPC (recommended) you can only locate nodes in Availability Zones that are associated with the subnets in the selected subnet group.

     

    The number of Availability Zones listed must equal the value of ``NumCacheNodes`` .

     

   

  If you want all the nodes in the same Availability Zone, use ``PreferredAvailabilityZone`` instead, or repeat the Availability Zone multiple times in the list.

   

  Default: System chosen Availability Zones.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--num-cache-nodes`` (integer)


  The initial number of cache nodes that the cluster has.

   

  For clusters running Redis, this value must be 1. For clusters running Memcached, this value must be between 1 and 20.

   

  If you need more than 20 nodes for your Memcached cluster, please fill out the ElastiCache Limit Increase Request form at `http\://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/elasticache-node-limit-request/ <http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/elasticache-node-limit-request/>`__ .

      CacheNodeId -> (string)

        

        The cache node identifier. A node ID is a numeric identifier (0001, 0002, etc.). The combination of cluster ID and node ID uniquely identifies every cache node used in a customer's AWS account.

        

        

      CacheNodeStatus -> (string)

        

        The current state of this cache node.

        

        

      CacheNodeCreateTime -> (timestamp)

        

        The date and time when the cache node was created.

        

        

      Endpoint -> (structure)

        

        The hostname for connecting to this cache node.

        

        Address -> (string)

          

          The DNS hostname of the cache node.

          

          

        Port -> (integer)

          

          The port number that the cache engine is listening on.

          

          

        

      ParameterGroupStatus -> (string)

        

        The status of the parameter group applied to this cache node.

        

        

      SourceCacheNodeId -> (string)

        

        The ID of the primary node to which this read replica node is synchronized. If this field is empty, this node is not associated with a primary cluster.

        

        

      CustomerAvailabilityZone -> (string)

        

        The Availability Zone where this node was created and now resides.

        

        

      

    

  AutoMinorVersionUpgrade -> (boolean)

    

    This parameter is currently disabled.

    

    

  SecurityGroups -> (list)

    

    A list of VPC Security Groups associated with the cluster.

    

    (structure)

      

      Represents a single cache security group and its status.

      

      SecurityGroupId -> (string)

        

        The identifier of the cache security group.

        

        

      Status -> (string)

        

        The status of the cache security group membership. The status changes whenever a cache security group is modified, or when the cache security groups assigned to a cluster are modified.

        

        

      

    

  ReplicationGroupId -> (string)

    

    The replication group to which this cluster belongs. If this field is empty, the cluster is not associated with any replication group.

    

    

  SnapshotRetentionLimit -> (integer)

    

    The number of days for which ElastiCache retains automatic cluster snapshots before deleting them. For example, if you set ``SnapshotRetentionLimit`` to 5, a snapshot that was taken today is retained for 5 days before being deleted.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If the value of SnapshotRetentionLimit is set to zero (0), backups are turned off.

       

    

    

  SnapshotWindow -> (string)

    

    The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache begins taking a daily snapshot of your cluster.

     

    Example: ``05:00-09:00``  

    

    

  AuthTokenEnabled -> (boolean)

    

    A flag that enables using an ``AuthToken`` (password) when issuing Redis commands.

     

    Default: ``false``  

    

    

  TransitEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)

    

    A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to ``true`` .

     

    You cannot modify the value of ``TransitEncryptionEnabled`` after the cluster is created. To enable in-transit encryption on a cluster you must set ``TransitEncryptionEnabled`` to ``true`` when you create a cluster.

     

     **Required:** Only available when creating a replication group in an Amazon VPC using redis version ``3.2.6`` or ``4.x`` .

     

    Default: ``false``  

    

    

  AtRestEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)

    

    A flag that enables encryption at-rest when set to ``true`` .

     

    You cannot modify the value of ``AtRestEncryptionEnabled`` after the cluster is created. To enable at-rest encryption on a cluster you must set ``AtRestEncryptionEnabled`` to ``true`` when you create a cluster.

     

     **Required:** Only available when creating a replication group in an Amazon VPC using redis version ``3.2.6`` or ``4.x`` .

     

    Default: ``false``
