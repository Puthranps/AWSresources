******************

******************



===========
Description
===========



Returns information about cluster or replication group snapshots. By default, ``DescribeSnapshots`` lists all of your snapshots; it can optionally describe a single snapshot, or just the snapshots associated with a particular cache cluster.

 

.. note::

   

  This operation is valid for Redis only.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``describe-snapshots`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Snapshots``

=======
Options
=======

``--replication-group-id`` (string)


  A user-supplied replication group identifier. If this parameter is specified, only snapshots associated with that specific replication group are described.

  

``--cache-cluster-id`` (string)


  A user-supplied cluster identifier. If this parameter is specified, only snapshots associated with that specific cluster are described.

  

``--snapshot-name`` (string)


  A user-supplied name of the snapshot. If this parameter is specified, only this snapshot are described.

  

``--snapshot-source`` (string)


  If set to ``system`` , the output shows snapshots that were automatically created by ElastiCache. If set to ``user`` the output shows snapshots that were manually created. If omitted, the output shows both automatically and manually created snapshots.

  

``--show-node-group-config`` | ``--no-show-node-group-config`` (boolean)


  A Boolean value which if true, the node group (shard) configuration is included in the snapshot description.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

      The name of the compute and memory capacity node type for the source cluster.

       

      The following node types are supported by ElastiCache. Generally speaking, the current generation types provide more memory and computational power at lower cost when compared to their equivalent previous generation counterparts.

       

       
      * General purpose: 

         
        * Current generation:   **T2 node types:**  ``cache.t2.micro`` , ``cache.t2.small`` , ``cache.t2.medium``    **M3 node types:**  ``cache.m3.medium`` , ``cache.m3.large`` , ``cache.m3.xlarge`` , ``cache.m3.2xlarge``    **M4 node types:**  ``cache.m4.large`` , ``cache.m4.xlarge`` , ``cache.m4.2xlarge`` , ``cache.m4.4xlarge`` , ``cache.m4.10xlarge``
