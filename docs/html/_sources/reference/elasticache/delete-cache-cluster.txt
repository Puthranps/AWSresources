********************
delete-cache-cluster
********************



===========
Description
===========



Deletes a previously provisioned cluster. ``DeleteCacheCluster`` deletes all associated cache nodes, node endpoints and the cluster itself. When you receive a successful response from this operation, Amazon ElastiCache immediately begins deleting the cluster; you cannot cancel or revert this operation.

 

This operation cannot be used to delete a cluster that is the last read replica of a replication group or node group (shard) that has Multi-AZ mode enabled or a cluster from a Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group.

 

This operation is not valid for Redis (cluster mode enabled) clusters.

Synopsis

::

    delete-cache-cluster
  --cache-cluster-id <value>
  [--final-snapshot-identifier <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--cache-cluster-id`` (string)


  The cluster identifier for the cluster to be deleted. This parameter is not case sensitive.

  

``--final-snapshot-identifier`` (string)


  The user-supplied name of a final cluster snapshot. This is the unique name that identifies the snapshot. ElastiCache creates the snapshot, and then deletes the cluster immediately afterward.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
