*************
test-failover
*************



===========
Description
===========



Represents the input of a ``TestFailover`` operation which test automatic failover on a specified node group (called shard in the console) in a replication group (called cluster in the console).

 

 **Note the following**  

 

 
* A customer can use this operation to test automatic failover on up to 5 shards (called node groups in the ElastiCache API and AWS CLI) in any rolling 24-hour period. 
 
* If calling this operation on shards in different clusters (called replication groups in the API and CLI), the calls can be made concurrently.   
 
* If calling this operation multiple times on different shards in the same Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group, the first node replacement must complete before a subsequent call can be made. 
 
* To determine whether the node replacement is complete you can check Events using the Amazon ElastiCache console, the AWS CLI, or the ElastiCache API. Look for the following automatic failover related events, listed here in order of occurrance: 

   
  * Replication group message: ``Test Failover API called for node group <node-group-id>``   
   
  * Cache cluster message: ``Failover from master node <primary-node-id> to replica node <node-id> completed``   
   
  * Replication group message: ``Failover from master node <primary-node-id> to replica node <node-id> completed``   
   
  * Cache cluster message: ``Recovering cache nodes <node-id>``   
   
  * Cache cluster message: ``Finished recovery for cache nodes <node-id>``

=======
Options
=======

``--replication-group-id`` (string)


  The name of the replication group (console: cluster) whose automatic failover is being tested by this operation.

  

``--node-group-id`` (string)


  The name of the node group (called shard in the console) in this replication group on which automatic failover is to be tested. You may test automatic failover on up to 5 node groups in any rolling 24-hour period.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

    If you do not specify this parameter, ElastiCache automatically chooses an appropriate time range.

     

    .. note::

       

      This parameter is only valid if the ``Engine`` parameter is ``redis`` .

       

    

    

  ClusterEnabled -> (boolean)

    

    A flag indicating whether or not this replication group is cluster enabled; i.e., whether its data can be partitioned across multiple shards (API/CLI: node groups).

     

    Valid values: ``true`` | ``false``  

    

    

  CacheNodeType -> (string)

  AuthTokenEnabled -> (boolean)

    

    A flag that enables using an ``AuthToken`` (password) when issuing Redis commands.

     

    Default: ``false``  

    

    

  TransitEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)

    

    A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to ``true`` .

     

    You cannot modify the value of ``TransitEncryptionEnabled`` after the cluster is created. To enable in-transit encryption on a cluster you must set ``TransitEncryptionEnabled`` to ``true`` when you create a cluster.
