===========
Description
===========



Returns information about all provisioned clusters if no cluster identifier is specified, or about a specific cache cluster if a cluster identifier is supplied.

 

By default, abbreviated information about the clusters is returned. You can use the optional *ShowCacheNodeInfo* flag to retrieve detailed information about the cache nodes associated with the clusters. These details include the DNS address and port for the cache node endpoint.

 

If the cluster is in the *creating* state, only cluster-level information is displayed until all of the nodes are successfully provisioned.

 

If the cluster is in the *deleting* state, only cluster-level information is displayed.

 

If cache nodes are currently being added to the cluster, node endpoint information and creation time for the additional nodes are not displayed until they are completely provisioned. When the cluster state is *available* , the cluster is ready for use.

 

If cache nodes are currently being removed from the cluster, no endpoint information for the removed nodes is displayed.

``describe-cache-clusters`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``CacheClusters``

=======
Options
=======

``--cache-cluster-id`` (string)


  The user-supplied cluster identifier. If this parameter is specified, only information about that specific cluster is returned. This parameter isn't case sensitive.

  

``--show-cache-node-info`` | ``--no-show-cache-node-info`` (boolean)


  An optional flag that can be included in the ``DescribeCacheCluster`` request to retrieve information about the individual cache nodes.

  

``--show-cache-clusters-not-in-replication-groups`` | ``--no-show-cache-clusters-not-in-replication-groups`` (boolean)


  An optional flag that can be included in the ``DescribeCacheCluster`` request to show only nodes (API/CLI: clusters) that are not members of a replication group. In practice, this mean Memcached and single node Redis clusters.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
