=======
Options
=======

``--reserved-elasticsearch-instance-id`` (string)


  The reserved instance identifier filter value. Use this parameter to show only the reservation that matches the specified reserved Elasticsearch instance ID.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Set this value to limit the number of results returned. If not specified, defaults to 100.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  NextToken should be sent in case if earlier API call produced result containing NextToken. It is used for pagination.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
