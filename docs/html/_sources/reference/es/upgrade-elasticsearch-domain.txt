Options
=======

``--domain-name`` (string)


  The name of an Elasticsearch domain. Domain names are unique across the domains owned by an account within an AWS region. Domain names start with a letter or number and can contain the following characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

  

``--target-version`` (string)


  The version of Elasticsearch that you intend to upgrade the domain to.

  

``--perform-check-only`` | ``--no-perform-check-only`` (boolean)


  This flag, when set to True, indicates that an Upgrade Eligibility Check needs to be performed. This will not actually perform the Upgrade. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
