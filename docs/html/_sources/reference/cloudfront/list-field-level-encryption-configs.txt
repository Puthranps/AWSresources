Options
=======

``--marker`` (string)


  Use this when paginating results to indicate where to begin in your list of configurations. The results include configurations in the list that occur after the marker. To get the next page of results, set the ``Marker`` to the value of the ``NextMarker`` from the current page's response (which is also the ID of the last configuration on that page). 

  

``--max-items`` (string)


  The maximum number of field-level encryption configurations you want in the response body. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

      A summary of a field-level encryption item.

      

      Id -> (string)

        

        The unique ID of a field-level encryption item.

        

        

      LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)

        ForwardWhenQueryArgProfileIsUnknown -> (boolean)

          

          Flag to set if you want a request to be forwarded to the origin even if the profile specified by the field-level encryption query argument, fle-profile, is unknown.

          

          

        QueryArgProfiles -> (structure)

          

          Profiles specified for query argument-profile mapping for field-level encryption.

          

          Quantity -> (integer)
