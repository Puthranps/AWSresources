  Request to update a field-level encryption profile. 

  



JSON Syntax::

    "CallerReference": "string",
    "Comment": "string",
    "EncryptionEntities": {
      "Quantity": integer,
      "Items": [

          }
        }
        ...
      ]
    }
  }



``--id`` (string)


  The ID of the field-level encryption profile request. 

  

``--if-match`` (string)


  The value of the ``ETag`` header that you received when retrieving the profile identity to update. For example: ``E2QWRUHAPOMQZL`` .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

FieldLevelEncryptionProfile -> (structure)

  

  Return the results of updating the profile.

  

  Id -> (string)

    

    The ID for a field-level encryption profile configuration which includes a set of profiles that specify certain selected data fields to be encrypted by specific public keys.

    

    

  LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)

    

    The last time the field-level encryption profile was updated.

    

    

  FieldLevelEncryptionProfileConfig -> (structure)

    

    A complex data type that includes the profile name and the encryption entities for the field-level encryption profile.

    

    Name -> (string)

      

      Profile name for the field-level encryption profile.

      

      

    CallerReference -> (string)

      

      A unique number that ensures the request can't be replayed.

      

      

    Comment -> (string)

      

      An optional comment for the field-level encryption profile.

      

      

    EncryptionEntities -> (structure)

      

      A complex data type of encryption entities for the field-level encryption profile that include the public key ID, provider, and field patterns for specifying which fields to encrypt with this key.

      

      Quantity -> (integer)

        

        Number of field pattern items in a field-level encryption content type-profile mapping. 

        

        

      Items -> (list)

        

        An array of field patterns in a field-level encryption content type-profile mapping. 

        

        (structure)

          

          Complex data type for field-level encryption profiles that includes the encryption key and field pattern specifications. 

          

          PublicKeyId -> (string)

            

            The public key associated with a set of field-level encryption patterns, to be used when encrypting the fields that match the patterns. 

            

            

          ProviderId -> (string)

            

            The provider associated with the public key being used for encryption. This value must also be provided with the private key for applications to be able to decrypt data.

            

            

          FieldPatterns -> (structure)

            

            Field patterns in a field-level encryption content type profile specify the fields that you want to be encrypted. You can provide the full field name, or any beginning characters followed by a wildcard (*). You can't overlap field patterns. For example, you can't have both ABC* and AB*. Note that field patterns are case-sensitive. 

            

            Quantity -> (integer)

              

              The number of field-level encryption field patterns.

              

              

            Items -> (list)

              

              An array of the field-level encryption field patterns.

              

              (string)

                

                

              

            

          

        

      

    

  

ETag -> (string)

  

  The result of the field-level encryption profile request.
