Description

Request a list of field-level encryption profiles that have been created in CloudFront for this account.

=======
Options
=======

``--marker`` (string)


  Use this when paginating results to indicate where to begin in your list of profiles. The results include profiles in the list that occur after the marker. To get the next page of results, set the ``Marker`` to the value of the ``NextMarker`` from the current page's response (which is also the ID of the last profile on that page). 

  

``--max-items`` (string)


  The maximum number of field-level encryption profiles you want in the response body. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output
======

FieldLevelEncryptionProfileList -> (structure)

  

  Returns a list of the field-level encryption profiles that have been created in CloudFront for this account.

  

  NextMarker -> (string)

    

    If there are more elements to be listed, this element is present and contains the value that you can use for the ``Marker`` request parameter to continue listing your profiles where you left off.

    

    

  MaxItems -> (integer)

    

    The maximum number of field-level encryption profiles you want in the response body. 

    

    

  Quantity -> (integer)

    

    The number of field-level encryption profiles.

    

    

  Items -> (list)

    

    The field-level encryption profile items.

    

    (structure)

      

      The field-level encryption profile summary.

      

      Id -> (string)

        

        ID for the field-level encryption profile summary.

        

        

      LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)

        

        The time when the the field-level encryption profile summary was last updated.

        

        

      Name -> (string)

        

        Name for the field-level encryption profile summary.

        

        

      EncryptionEntities -> (structure)

        

        A complex data type of encryption entities for the field-level encryption profile that include the public key ID, provider, and field patterns for specifying which fields to encrypt with this key.

        

        Quantity -> (integer)

          

          Number of field pattern items in a field-level encryption content type-profile mapping. 

          

          

        Items -> (list)

          

          An array of field patterns in a field-level encryption content type-profile mapping. 

          

          (structure)

            

            Complex data type for field-level encryption profiles that includes the encryption key and field pattern specifications. 

            

            PublicKeyId -> (string)

              

              The public key associated with a set of field-level encryption patterns, to be used when encrypting the fields that match the patterns. 

              

              

            ProviderId -> (string)

              

              The provider associated with the public key being used for encryption. This value must also be provided with the private key for applications to be able to decrypt data.

              

              

            FieldPatterns -> (structure)

              

              Field patterns in a field-level encryption content type profile specify the fields that you want to be encrypted. You can provide the full field name, or any beginning characters followed by a wildcard (*). You can't overlap field patterns. For example, you can't have both ABC* and AB*. Note that field patterns are case-sensitive. 

              

              Quantity -> (integer)

                

                The number of field-level encryption field patterns.

      Comment -> (string)

        

        An optional comment for the field-level encryption profile summary.
