Options
=======

``--marker`` (string)


  Use this when paginating results to indicate where to begin in your list of public keys. The results include public keys in the list that occur after the marker. To get the next page of results, set the ``Marker`` to the value of the ``NextMarker`` from the current page's response (which is also the ID of the last public key on that page). 

  

``--max-items`` (string)


  The maximum number of public keys you want in the response body. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
