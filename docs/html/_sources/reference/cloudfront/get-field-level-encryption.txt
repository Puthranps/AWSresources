Options

``--id`` (string)


  Request the ID for the field-level encryption configuration information.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

FieldLevelEncryption -> (structure)

  

  Return the field-level encryption configuration information.

  

  Id -> (string)

    

    The configuration ID for a field-level encryption configuration which includes a set of profiles that specify certain selected data fields to be encrypted by specific public keys.

    

    

  LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)

    

    The last time the field-level encryption configuration was changed. 

    

    

  FieldLevelEncryptionConfig -> (structure)

    

    A complex data type that includes the profile configurations specified for field-level encryption. 

    

    CallerReference -> (string)

      

      A unique number that ensures the request can't be replayed.

      

      

    Comment -> (string)

      

      An optional comment about the configuration.

      

      

    QueryArgProfileConfig -> (structure)

      

      A complex data type that specifies when to forward content if a profile isn't found and the profile that can be provided as a query argument in a request.

      

      ForwardWhenQueryArgProfileIsUnknown -> (boolean)

        

        Flag to set if you want a request to be forwarded to the origin even if the profile specified by the field-level encryption query argument, fle-profile, is unknown.

        

        

      QueryArgProfiles -> (structure)

        

        Profiles specified for query argument-profile mapping for field-level encryption.

        

        Quantity -> (integer)

          

          Number of profiles for query argument-profile mapping for field-level encryption.

          

          

        Items -> (list)

          

          Number of items for query argument-profile mapping for field-level encryption.

          

          (structure)

            

            Query argument-profile mapping for field-level encryption.

            

            QueryArg -> (string)

              

              Query argument for field-level encryption query argument-profile mapping.

              

              

            ProfileId -> (string)

              

              ID of profile to use for field-level encryption query argument-profile mapping

              

              

            

          

        

      

    ContentTypeProfileConfig -> (structure)

      

      A complex data type that specifies when to forward content if a content type isn't recognized and profiles to use as by default in a request if a query argument doesn't specify a profile to use.

      

      ForwardWhenContentTypeIsUnknown -> (boolean)

        

        The setting in a field-level encryption content type-profile mapping that specifies what to do when an unknown content type is provided for the profile. If true, content is forwarded without being encrypted when the content type is unknown. If false (the default), an error is returned when the content type is unknown. 

        

        

      ContentTypeProfiles -> (structure)

        

        The configuration for a field-level encryption content type-profile.

          The number of field-level encryption content type-profile mappings. 

          

          

        Items -> (list)

            ProfileId -> (string)

              

              The profile ID for a field-level encryption content type-profile mapping. 

              

              

            ContentType -> (string)

              

              The content type for a field-level encryption content type-profile mapping.
