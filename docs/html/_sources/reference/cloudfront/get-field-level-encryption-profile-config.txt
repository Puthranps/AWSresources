    get-field-level-encryption-profile-config
  --id <value>

Options
=======

``--id`` (string)


  Get the ID for the field-level encryption profile configuration information.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

FieldLevelEncryptionProfileConfig -> (structure)

  

  Return the field-level encryption profile configuration information.

  

  Name -> (string)

    

    Profile name for the field-level encryption profile.

    

    

  CallerReference -> (string)

    

    A unique number that ensures the request can't be replayed.

    

    

  Comment -> (string)

    

    An optional comment for the field-level encryption profile.

    

    

  EncryptionEntities -> (structure)

    

    A complex data type of encryption entities for the field-level encryption profile that include the public key ID, provider, and field patterns for specifying which fields to encrypt with this key.

    

    Quantity -> (integer)

      

      Number of field pattern items in a field-level encryption content type-profile mapping. 

      

      

    Items -> (list)

      

      An array of field patterns in a field-level encryption content type-profile mapping. 

      

      (structure)

        

        Complex data type for field-level encryption profiles that includes the encryption key and field pattern specifications. 

        

        PublicKeyId -> (string)

          

          The public key associated with a set of field-level encryption patterns, to be used when encrypting the fields that match the patterns. 

          

          

        ProviderId -> (string)

          

          The provider associated with the public key being used for encryption. This value must also be provided with the private key for applications to be able to decrypt data.

          

          

        FieldPatterns -> (structure)

          

          Field patterns in a field-level encryption content type profile specify the fields that you want to be encrypted. You can provide the full field name, or any beginning characters followed by a wildcard (*). You can't overlap field patterns. For example, you can't have both ABC* and AB*. Note that field patterns are case-sensitive. 

          

          Quantity -> (integer)

            

            The number of field-level encryption field patterns.

            

            

          Items -> (list)

            

            An array of the field-level encryption field patterns.

            

            (string)

              

              

            

          

        

      

    

  

ETag -> (string)

  

  The current version of the field-level encryption profile configuration result. For example: ``E2QWRUHAPOMQZL`` .
