===========
Description
===========



This action returns a list of the different Amazon EC2 Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that are owned by your AWS account that would be supported for use on a Snowball Edge device. Currently, supported AMIs are based on the CentOS 7 (x86_64) - with Updates HVM, Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (HVM), and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS - Xenial (HVM) images, available on the AWS Marketplace.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis
========

::

    list-compatible-images
  [--max-results <value>]
  [--next-token <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results for the list of compatible images. Currently, a Snowball Edge device can store 10 AMIs.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  HTTP requests are stateless. To identify what object comes "next" in the list of compatible images, you can specify a value for ``NextToken`` as the starting point for your list of returned images.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Output
======

CompatibleImages -> (list)

  

  A JSON-formatted object that describes a compatible AMI, including the ID and name for a Snowball Edge AMI.

  

  (structure)

    

    A JSON-formatted object that describes a compatible Amazon Machine Image (AMI), including the ID and name for a Snowball Edge AMI. This AMI is compatible with the device's physical hardware requirements, and it should be able to be run in an SBE1 instance on the device.

    

    AmiId -> (string)

      

      The unique identifier for an individual Snowball Edge AMI.

      

      

    Name -> (string)

      

      The optional name of a compatible image.

      

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  Because HTTP requests are stateless, this is the starting point for your next list of returned images.
