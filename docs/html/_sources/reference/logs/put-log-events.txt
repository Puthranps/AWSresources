===========
Description
===========



Uploads a batch of log events to the specified log stream.

 

You must include the sequence token obtained from the response of the previous call. An upload in a newly created log stream does not require a sequence token. You can also get the sequence token using  DescribeLogStreams . If you call ``PutLogEvents`` twice within a narrow time period using the same value for ``sequenceToken`` , both calls may be successful, or one may be rejected.

 

The batch of events must satisfy the following constraints:

 

 
* The maximum batch size is 1,048,576 bytes, and this size is calculated as the sum of all event messages in UTF-8, plus 26 bytes for each log event. 
 
* None of the log events in the batch can be more than 2 hours in the future. 
 
* None of the log events in the batch can be older than 14 days or the retention period of the log group. 
 
* The log events in the batch must be in chronological ordered by their time stamp. The time stamp is the time the event occurred, expressed as the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. (In AWS Tools for PowerShell and the AWS SDK for .NET, the timestamp is specified in .NET format: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss. For example, 2017-09-15T13:45:30.)  
 
* The maximum number of log events in a batch is 10,000. 
 
* A batch of log events in a single request cannot span more than 24 hours. Otherwise, the operation fails. 
 

 

If a call to PutLogEvents returns "UnrecognizedClientException" the most likely cause is an invalid AWS access key ID or secret key.

Options
=======

``--log-group-name`` (string)


  The name of the log group.

  

``--log-stream-name`` (string)


  The name of the log stream.

  

``--log-events`` (list)


  The log events.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    timestamp=long,message=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "timestamp": long,
      "message": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--sequence-token`` (string)


  The sequence token obtained from the response of the previous ``PutLogEvents`` call. An upload in a newly created log stream does not require a sequence token. You can also get the sequence token using  DescribeLogStreams . If you call ``PutLogEvents`` twice within a narrow time period using the same value for ``sequenceToken`` , both calls may be successful, or one may be rejected.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


========
Examples
========

The following command puts log events to a log stream named ``20150601`` in the log group ``my-logs``::

  aws logs put-log-events --log-group-name my-logs --log-stream-name 20150601 --log-events file://events

Output::

  {
      "nextSequenceToken": "49542672486831074009579604567656788214806863282469607346"
  }

The above example reads a JSON array of events from a file named ``events`` in the current directory::

  [
    {
      "timestamp": 1433190184356,
      "message": "Example Event 1"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": 1433190184358,
      "message": "Example Event 2"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": 1433190184360,
      "message": "Example Event 3"
    }
  ]

Each subsequent call requires the next sequence token provided by the previous call to be specified with the sequence token option::

  aws logs put-log-events --log-group-name my-logs --log-stream-name 20150601 --log-events file://events2 --sequence-token "49542672486831074009579604567656788214806863282469607346"

Output::

  {
      "nextSequenceToken": "49542672486831074009579604567900991230369019956308219826"
  }
