.. _cli:aws logs put-destination:


***************
put-destination
***************



===========
Description
===========



Creates or updates a destination. A destination encapsulates a physical resource (such as an Amazon Kinesis stream) and enables you to subscribe to a real-time stream of log events for a different account, ingested using  PutLogEvents . Currently, the only supported physical resource is a Kinesis stream belonging to the same account as the destination.

 

Through an access policy, a destination controls what is written to its Kinesis stream. By default, ``PutDestination`` does not set any access policy with the destination, which means a cross-account user cannot call  PutSubscriptionFilter against this destination. To enable this, the destination owner must call  PutDestinationPolicy after ``PutDestination`` .

=======
Options
=======

``--destination-name`` (string)


  A name for the destination.

  

``--target-arn`` (string)


  The ARN of an Amazon Kinesis stream to which to deliver matching log events.

  

``--role-arn`` (string)


  The ARN of an IAM role that grants CloudWatch Logs permissions to call the Amazon Kinesis PutRecord operation on the destination stream.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
