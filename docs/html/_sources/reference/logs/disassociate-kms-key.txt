********************
disassociate-kms-key
********************



===========
Description
===========



Disassociates the associated AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) from the specified log group.

 

After the AWS KMS CMK is disassociated from the log group, AWS CloudWatch Logs stops encrypting newly ingested data for the log group. All previously ingested data remains encrypted, and AWS CloudWatch Logs requires permissions for the CMK whenever the encrypted data is requested.

 

Note that it can take up to 5 minutes for this operation to take effect.

``--log-group-name`` (string)


  The name of the log group.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
