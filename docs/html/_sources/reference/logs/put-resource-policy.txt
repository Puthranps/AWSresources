=======
Options
=======

``--policy-name`` (string)


  Name of the new policy. This parameter is required.

  

``--policy-document`` (string)


  Details of the new policy, including the identity of the principal that is enabled to put logs to this account. This is formatted as a JSON string.

   

  The following example creates a resource policy enabling the Route 53 service to put DNS query logs in to the specified log group. Replace "logArn" with the ARN of your CloudWatch Logs resource, such as a log group or log stream.

   

   ``{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "Route53LogsToCloudWatchLogs", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "Service": [ "route53.amazonaws.com" ] }, "Action":"logs:PutLogEvents", "Resource": "logArn" } ] }``  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
