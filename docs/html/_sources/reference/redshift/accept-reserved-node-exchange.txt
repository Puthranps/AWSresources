===========
Description
===========



Exchanges a DC1 Reserved Node for a DC2 Reserved Node with no changes to the configuration (term, payment type, or number of nodes) and no additional costs.

Options

``--reserved-node-id`` (string)


  A string representing the node identifier of the DC1 Reserved Node to be exchanged.

  

``--target-reserved-node-offering-id`` (string)


  The unique identifier of the DC2 Reserved Node offering to be used for the exchange. You can obtain the value for the parameter by calling  GetReservedNodeExchangeOfferings  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
