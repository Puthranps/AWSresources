=======
Options
=======

``--maintenance-track-name`` (string)


  The name of the maintenance track. 

  

``--max-records`` (integer)


  An integer value for the maximum number of maintenance tracks to return.

  

``--marker`` (string)


  An optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return a set of response records. When the results of a ``DescribeClusterTracks`` request exceed the value specified in ``MaxRecords`` , Amazon Redshift returns a value in the ``Marker`` field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of response records by providing the returned marker value in the ``Marker`` parameter and retrying the request. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

MaintenanceTracks -> (list)

  

  A list of maintenance tracks output by the ``DescribeClusterTracks`` operation. 

  

  (structure)

    

    Defines a maintenance track that determines which Amazon Redshift version to apply during a maintenance window. If the value for ``MaintenanceTrack`` is ``current`` , the cluster is updated to the most recently certified maintenance release. If the value is ``trailing`` , the cluster is updated to the previously certified maintenance release. 

    

    MaintenanceTrackName -> (string)

      

      The name of the maintenance track. Possible values are ``current`` and ``trailing`` .

      

      

    DatabaseVersion -> (string)

      

      The version number for the cluster release.

      

      

    UpdateTargets -> (list)

      

      An array of  UpdateTarget objects to update with the maintenance track. 

      

      (structure)

        

        A maintenance track that you can switch the current track to.

        

        MaintenanceTrackName -> (string)

          

          The name of the new maintenance track.

          

          

        DatabaseVersion -> (string)

          

          The cluster version for the new maintenance track.

          

          

        

      

    

  

Marker -> (string)

  

  The starting point to return a set of response tracklist records. You can retrieve the next set of response records by providing the returned marker value in the ``Marker`` parameter and retrying the request.
