=======
Options
=======

``--job-id`` (string)


  The unique identifier assigned to this job when it was created.

  

``--thing-name`` (string)


  The thing name associated with the device the job execution is running on.

  

``--include-job-document`` | ``--no-include-job-document`` (boolean)


  Optional. When set to true, the response contains the job document. The default is false.

  

``--execution-number`` (long)


  Optional. A number that identifies a particular job execution on a particular device. If not specified, the latest job execution is returned.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

  statusDetails -> (map)

    

    A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the job execution.

    

    key -> (string)

      

      

    value -> (string)

      

      

    

  queuedAt -> (long)

    

    The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution was enqueued.
