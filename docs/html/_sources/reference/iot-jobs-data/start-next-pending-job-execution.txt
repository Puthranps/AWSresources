Description

=======
Options
=======

``--thing-name`` (string)


  The name of the thing associated with the device.

  

``--status-details`` (map)


  A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the job execution. If not specified, the statusDetails are unchanged.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string




JSON Syntax::

  {"string": "string"
    ...}



``--step-timeout-in-minutes`` (long)


  Specifies the amount of time this device has to finish execution of this job. If the job execution status is not set to a terminal state before this timer expires, or before the timer is reset (by calling ``UpdateJobExecution`` , setting the status to ``IN_PROGRESS`` and specifying a new timeout value in field ``stepTimeoutInMinutes`` ) the job execution status will be automatically set to ``TIMED_OUT`` . Note that setting this timeout has no effect on that job execution timeout which may have been specified when the job was created (``CreateJob`` using field ``timeoutConfig`` ).

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output
======

execution -> (structure)

  

  A JobExecution object.

  

  jobId -> (string)

    

    The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.

    

    

  thingName -> (string)

    

    The name of the thing that is executing the job.

    

    

  status -> (string)

    

    The status of the job execution. Can be one of: "QUEUED", "IN_PROGRESS", "FAILED", "SUCCESS", "CANCELED", "REJECTED", or "REMOVED".

    

    

  statusDetails -> (map)

    

    A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the job execution.

    

    key -> (string)

      

      

    value -> (string)

      

      

    

  queuedAt -> (long)

    

    The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution was enqueued.

    

    

  startedAt -> (long)

    

    The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution was started.

    

    

  lastUpdatedAt -> (long)

    

    The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution was last updated. 

    

    

  approximateSecondsBeforeTimedOut -> (long)

    

    The estimated number of seconds that remain before the job execution status will be changed to ``TIMED_OUT`` .

    

    

  versionNumber -> (long)

    

    The version of the job execution. Job execution versions are incremented each time they are updated by a device.

    

    

  executionNumber -> (long)
