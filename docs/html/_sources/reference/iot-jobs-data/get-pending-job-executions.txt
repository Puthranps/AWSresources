Options
=======

``--thing-name`` (string)


  The name of the thing that is executing the job.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output

inProgressJobs -> (list)

  

  A list of JobExecutionSummary objects with status IN_PROGRESS.

  

  (structure)

    

    Contains a subset of information about a job execution.

    

    jobId -> (string)

      

      The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.

      

      

    queuedAt -> (long)

      

      The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution was enqueued.

      

      

    startedAt -> (long)

      

      The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execution started.

      

      

    lastUpdatedAt -> (long)

    executionNumber -> (long)

      

      A number that identifies a particular job execution on a particular device.
