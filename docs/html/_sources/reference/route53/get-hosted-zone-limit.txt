Options

``--type`` (string)


  The limit that you want to get. Valid values include the following:

   

   
  * **MAX_RRSETS_BY_ZONE** : The maximum number of records that you can create in the specified hosted zone. 
   
  * **MAX_VPCS_ASSOCIATED_BY_ZONE** : The maximum number of Amazon VPCs that you can associate with the specified private hosted zone. 
   

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``MAX_RRSETS_BY_ZONE``

  
  *   ``MAX_VPCS_ASSOCIATED_BY_ZONE``

  

  

``--hosted-zone-id`` (string)


  The ID of the hosted zone that you want to get a limit for.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
