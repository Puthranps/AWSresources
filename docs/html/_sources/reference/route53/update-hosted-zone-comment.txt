Synopsis

    update-hosted-zone-comment
  --id <value>
  [--comment <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--id`` (string)


  The ID for the hosted zone that you want to update the comment for.

  

``--comment`` (string)


  The new comment for the hosted zone. If you don't specify a value for ``Comment`` , Amazon Route 53 deletes the existing value of the ``Comment`` element, if any.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
