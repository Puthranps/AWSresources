Description
===========



Removes the DDoS Response team's (DRT) access to your AWS account.

 

To make a ``DisassociateDRTRole`` request, you must be subscribed to the `Business Support plan <https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/business-support/>`__ or the `Enterprise Support plan <https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/enterprise-support/>`__ . However, if you are not subscribed to one of these support plans, but had been previously and had granted the DRT access to your account, you can submit a ``DisassociateDRTRole`` request to remove this access.

Options

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
