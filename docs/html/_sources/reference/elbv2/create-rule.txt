===========
Description
===========



Creates a rule for the specified listener. The listener must be associated with an Application Load Balancer.

 

Rules are evaluated in priority order, from the lowest value to the highest value. When the conditions for a rule are met, its actions are performed. If the conditions for no rules are met, the actions for the default rule are performed. For more information, see `Listener Rules <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-listeners.html#listener-rules>`__ in the *Application Load Balancers Guide* .

 

To view your current rules, use  DescribeRules . To update a rule, use  ModifyRule . To set the priorities of your rules, use  SetRulePriorities . To delete a rule, use  DeleteRule .

=======
Options

``--listener-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

  

``--conditions`` (list)


  The conditions. Each condition specifies a field name and a single value.

   

  If the field name is ``host-header`` , you can specify a single host name (for example, my.example.com). A host name is case insensitive, can be up to 128 characters in length, and can contain any of the following characters. You can include up to three wildcard characters.

   

   
  * A-Z, a-z, 0-9 
   
  * - . 
   
  * * (matches 0 or more characters) 
   
  * ? (matches exactly 1 character) 
   

   

  If the field name is ``path-pattern`` , you can specify a single path pattern. A path pattern is case-sensitive, can be up to 128 characters in length, and can contain any of the following characters. You can include up to three wildcard characters.

   

   
  * A-Z, a-z, 0-9 
   
  * _ - . $ / ~ " ' @ : + 
   
  * & (using &amp;) 
   
  * * (matches 0 or more characters) 
   
  * ? (matches exactly 1 character)

    {
      "Field": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--priority`` (integer)


  The rule priority. A listener can't have multiple rules with the same priority.

  

``--actions`` (list)


  The actions. Each rule must include exactly one of the following types of actions: ``forward`` , ``fixed-response`` , or ``redirect`` .

   

  If the action type is ``forward`` , you can specify a single target group.

   

  [HTTPS listener] If the action type is ``authenticate-oidc`` , you can use an identity provider that is OpenID Connect (OIDC) compliant to authenticate users as they access your application.

   

  [HTTPS listener] If the action type is ``authenticate-cognito`` , you can use Amazon Cognito to authenticate users as they access your application.

   

  [Application Load Balancer] If the action type is ``redirect`` , you can redirect HTTP and HTTPS requests.

   

  [Application Load Balancer] If the action type is ``fixed-response`` , you can return a custom HTTP response.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
