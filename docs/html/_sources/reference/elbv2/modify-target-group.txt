Modifies the health checks used when evaluating the health state of the targets in the specified target group.

 

To monitor the health of the targets, use  DescribeTargetHealth .

=======
Options
=======

``--target-group-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group.

  

``--health-check-protocol`` (string)


  The protocol the load balancer uses when performing health checks on targets. The TCP protocol is supported only if the protocol of the target group is TCP.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``HTTP``

  
  *   ``HTTPS``

  
  *   ``TCP``

  

  

``--health-check-port`` (string)


  The port the load balancer uses when performing health checks on targets.

  

``--health-check-path`` (string)


  [HTTP/HTTPS health checks] The ping path that is the destination for the health check request.

  

``--health-check-interval-seconds`` (integer)


  The approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of an individual target. For Application Load Balancers, the range is 5–300 seconds. For Network Load Balancers, the supported values are 10 or 30 seconds.

  

``--health-check-timeout-seconds`` (integer)


  [HTTP/HTTPS health checks] The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response means a failed health check.

  

``--healthy-threshold-count`` (integer)


  The number of consecutive health checks successes required before considering an unhealthy target healthy.

  

``--unhealthy-threshold-count`` (integer)


  The number of consecutive health check failures required before considering the target unhealthy. For Network Load Balancers, this value must be the same as the healthy threshold count.

  

``--matcher`` (structure)


  [HTTP/HTTPS health checks] The HTTP codes to use when checking for a successful response from a target.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    HttpCode=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "HttpCode": "string"
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

**To modify the health check configuration for a target group**

This example changes the configuration of the health checks used to evaluate the health of the targets for the specified target group.
