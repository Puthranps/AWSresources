*******************



===========
Description
===========



Sets the priorities of the specified rules.

 

You can reorder the rules as long as there are no priority conflicts in the new order. Any existing rules that you do not specify retain their current priority.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/elasticloadbalancingv2-2015-12-01/SetRulePriorities>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


========
Synopsis
========

::

    set-rule-priorities
  --rule-priorities <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--rule-priorities`` (list)


  The rule priorities.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    RuleArn=string,Priority=integer ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "RuleArn": "string",
      "Priority": integer
    }
    ...
  ]



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
