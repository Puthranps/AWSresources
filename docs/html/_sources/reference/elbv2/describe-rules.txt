Description

=======
Options
=======

``--listener-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

  

``--rule-arns`` (list)


  The Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the rules.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--marker`` (string)


  The marker for the next set of results. (You received this marker from a previous call.)

  

``--page-size`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to return with this call.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
