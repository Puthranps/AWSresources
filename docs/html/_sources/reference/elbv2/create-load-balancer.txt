===========
Description
===========



Creates an Application Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer.

 

When you create a load balancer, you can specify security groups, public subnets, IP address type, and tags. Otherwise, you could do so later using  SetSecurityGroups ,  SetSubnets ,  SetIpAddressType , and  AddTags .

 

To create listeners for your load balancer, use  CreateListener . To describe your current load balancers, see  DescribeLoadBalancers . When you are finished with a load balancer, you can delete it using  DeleteLoadBalancer .

 

For limit information, see `Limits for Your Application Load Balancer <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-limits.html>`__ in the *Application Load Balancers Guide* and `Limits for Your Network Load Balancer <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-limits.html>`__ in the *Network Load Balancers Guide* .

 

This operation is idempotent, which means that it completes at most one time. If you attempt to create multiple load balancers with the same settings, each call succeeds.

 

For more information, see `Application Load Balancers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/application-load-balancers.html>`__ in the *Application Load Balancers Guide* and `Network Load Balancers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/network-load-balancers.html>`__ in the *Network Load Balancers Guide* .

=======
Options
=======

``--name`` (string)


  The name of the load balancer.

   

  This name must be unique per region per account, can have a maximum of 32 characters, must contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphens, must not begin or end with a hyphen, and must not begin with "internal-".

  

``--subnets`` (list)


  The IDs of the public subnets. You can specify only one subnet per Availability Zone. You must specify either subnets or subnet mappings.

   

  [Application Load Balancers] You must specify subnets from at least two Availability Zones.

   

  [Network Load Balancers] You can specify subnets from one or more Availability Zones.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--subnet-mappings`` (list)


  The IDs of the public subnets. You can specify only one subnet per Availability Zone. You must specify either subnets or subnet mappings.

   

  [Application Load Balancers] You must specify subnets from at least two Availability Zones. You cannot specify Elastic IP addresses for your subnets.

   

  [Network Load Balancers] You can specify subnets from one or more Availability Zones. You can specify one Elastic IP address per subnet.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    SubnetId=string,AllocationId=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "SubnetId": "string",
      "AllocationId": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--security-groups`` (list)


  [Application Load Balancers] The IDs of the security groups for the load balancer.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--scheme`` (string)


  The nodes of an Internet-facing load balancer have public IP addresses. The DNS name of an Internet-facing load balancer is publicly resolvable to the public IP addresses of the nodes. Therefore, Internet-facing load balancers can route requests from clients over the internet.

   

  The nodes of an internal load balancer have only private IP addresses. The DNS name of an internal load balancer is publicly resolvable to the private IP addresses of the nodes. Therefore, internal load balancers can only route requests from clients with access to the VPC for the load balancer.

   

  The default is an Internet-facing load balancer.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``internet-facing``

  
  *   ``internal``

  

  

``--tags`` (list)


  One or more tags to assign to the load balancer.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Key=string,Value=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",
      "Value": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--type`` (string)


  The type of load balancer. The default is ``application`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``application``

  
  *   ``network``

  

  

``--ip-address-type`` (string)


  [Application Load Balancers] The type of IP addresses used by the subnets for your load balancer. The possible values are ``ipv4`` (for IPv4 addresses) and ``dualstack`` (for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses). Internal load balancers must use ``ipv4`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``ipv4``

  
  *   ``dualstack``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
