Options
=======

``--username`` (string)


  The user name in Amazon Connect for the account to create.

  

``--password`` (string)


  The password for the user account to create. This is required if you are using Amazon Connect for identity management. If you are using SAML for identity management and include this parameter, an ``InvalidRequestException`` is returned.

  

``--identity-info`` (structure)


  Information about the user, including email address, first name, and last name.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    FirstName=string,LastName=string,Email=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "FirstName": "string",
    "LastName": "string",
    "Email": "string"
  }



``--phone-config`` (structure)


  Specifies the phone settings for the user, including AfterContactWorkTimeLimit, AutoAccept, DeskPhoneNumber, and PhoneType.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    PhoneType=string,AutoAccept=boolean,AfterContactWorkTimeLimit=integer,DeskPhoneNumber=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "PhoneType": "SOFT_PHONE"|"DESK_PHONE",
    "AutoAccept": true|false,
    "AfterContactWorkTimeLimit": integer,
    "DeskPhoneNumber": "string"
  }



``--directory-user-id`` (string)


  The unique identifier for the user account in the directory service directory used for identity management. If Amazon Connect is unable to access the existing directory, you can use the ``DirectoryUserId`` to authenticate users. If you include the parameter, it is assumed that Amazon Connect cannot access the directory. If the parameter is not included, the UserIdentityInfo is used to authenticate users from your existing directory.

   

  This parameter is required if you are using an existing directory for identity management in Amazon Connect when Amazon Connect cannot access your directory to authenticate users. If you are using SAML for identity management and include this parameter, an ``InvalidRequestException`` is returned.

  

``--security-profile-ids`` (list)


  The unique identifier of the security profile to assign to the user created.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--routing-profile-id`` (string)


  The unique identifier for the routing profile to assign to the user created.

  

``--hierarchy-group-id`` (string)


  The unique identifier for the hierarchy group to assign to the user created.

  

``--instance-id`` (string)


  The identifier for your Amazon Connect instance. To find the ID of your instance, open the AWS console and select Amazon Connect. Select the alias of the instance in the Instance alias column. The instance ID is displayed in the Overview section of your instance settings. For example, the instance ID is the set of characters at the end of the instance ARN, after instance/, such as 10a4c4eb-f57e-4d4c-b602-bf39176ced07.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
