===========
Description
===========



The ``GetMetricData`` operation retrieves historical metrics data from your Amazon Connect instance.

 

If you are using an IAM account, it must have permission to the ``connect:GetMetricData`` action.

Options

``--instance-id`` (string)


  The identifier for your Amazon Connect instance. To find the ID of your instance, open the AWS console and select Amazon Connect. Select the alias of the instance in the Instance alias column. The instance ID is displayed in the Overview section of your instance settings. For example, the instance ID is the set of characters at the end of the instance ARN, after instance/, such as 10a4c4eb-f57e-4d4c-b602-bf39176ced07.

  

``--start-time`` (timestamp)


  The timestamp, in UNIX Epoch time format, at which to start the reporting interval for the retrieval of historical metrics data. The time must be specified using a multiple of 5 minutes, such as 10:05, 10:10, 10:15.

   

   ``StartTime`` cannot be earlier than 24 hours before the time of the request. Historical metrics are available in Amazon Connect only for 24 hours.

  

``--end-time`` (timestamp)


  The timestamp, in UNIX Epoch time format, at which to end the reporting interval for the retrieval of historical metrics data. The time must be specified using an interval of 5 minutes, such as 11:00, 11:05, 11:10, and must be later than the ``StartTime`` timestamp.

   

  The time range between ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime`` must be less than 24 hours.

  

``--filters`` (structure)


  A ``Filters`` object that contains a list of queue IDs or queue ARNs, up to 100, or a list of Channels to use to filter the metrics returned in the response. Metric data is retrieved only for the resources associated with the IDs, ARNs, or Channels included in the filter. You can use both IDs and ARNs together in a request. Only VOICE is supported for Channel.

   

  To find the ARN for a queue, open the queue you want to use in the Amazon Connect Queue editor. The ARN for the queue is displayed in the address bar as part of the URL. For example, the queue ARN is the set of characters at the end of the URL, after 'id=' such as ``arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:270923740243:instance/78fb859d-1b7d-44b1-8aa3-12f0835c5855/queue/1d1a4575-9618-40ab-bbeb-81e45795fe61`` . The queue ID is also included in the URL, and is the string after 'queue/'.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Queues=string,string,Channels=string,string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "Queues": ["string", ...],
    "Channels": ["VOICE", ...]
  }



``--groupings`` (list)


  The grouping applied to the metrics returned. For example, when results are grouped by queueId, the metrics returned are grouped by queue. The values returned apply to the metrics for each queue rather than aggregated for all queues.

   

  The current version supports grouping by Queue

   

  If no ``Grouping`` is included in the request, a summary of ``HistoricalMetrics`` for all queues is returned.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...

  Where valid values are:
    QUEUE
    CHANNEL





``--historical-metrics`` (list)


  A list of ``HistoricalMetric`` objects that contain the metrics to retrieve with the request.

   

  A ``HistoricalMetric`` object contains: ``HistoricalMetricName`` , ``Statistic`` , ``Threshold`` , and ``Unit`` .

   

  For each historical metric you include in the request, you must include a ``Unit`` and a ``Statistic`` . 

   

  The following historical metrics are available:

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the previous response in the next request to retrieve the next set of results.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Indicates the maximum number of results to return per page in the response, between 1-100.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
