===========
Description
===========



The ``UpdateContactAttributes`` operation lets you programmatically create new, or update existing, contact attributes associated with a contact. You can use the operation to add or update attributes for both ongoing and completed contacts. For example, you can update the customer's name or the reason the customer called while the call is active, or add notes about steps that the agent took during the call that are displayed to the next agent that takes the call. You can also use the ``UpdateContactAttributes`` operation to update attributes for a contact using data from your CRM application and save the data with the contact in Amazon Connect. You could also flag calls for additional analysis, such as legal review or identifying abusive callers.

 

Contact attributes are available in Amazon Connect for 24 months, and are then deleted.

 

 *Important:*  

 

You cannot use the operation to update attributes for contacts that occurred prior to the release of the API, September 12, 2018. You can update attributes only for contacts that started after the release of the API. If you attempt to update attributes for a contact that occurred prior to the release of the API, a 400 error is returned. This applies also to queued callbacks that were initiated prior to the release of the API but are still active in your instance.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
