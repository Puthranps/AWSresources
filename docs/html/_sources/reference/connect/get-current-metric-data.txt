===========
Description
===========



The ``GetCurrentMetricData`` operation retrieves current metric data from your Amazon Connect instance.

 

If you are using an IAM account, it must have permission to the ``connect:GetCurrentMetricData`` action.

=======
Options
=======

``--instance-id`` (string)


  The identifier for your Amazon Connect instance. To find the ID of your instance, open the AWS console and select Amazon Connect. Select the alias of the instance in the Instance alias column. The instance ID is displayed in the Overview section of your instance settings. For example, the instance ID is the set of characters at the end of the instance ARN, after instance/, such as 10a4c4eb-f57e-4d4c-b602-bf39176ced07.

  

``--filters`` (structure)


  A ``Filters`` object that contains a list of queue IDs or queue ARNs, up to 100, or list of Channels to use to filter the metrics returned in the response. Metric data is retrieved only for the resources associated with the queue IDs, ARNs, or Channels included in the filter. You can include both IDs and ARNs in the same request. To retrieve metrics for all queues, add the queue ID or ARN for each queue in your instance. Only VOICE is supported for Channels.

   

  To find the ARN for a queue, open the queue you want to use in the Amazon Connect Queue editor. The ARN for the queue is displayed in the address bar as part of the URL. For example, the queue ARN is the set of characters at the end of the URL, after 'id=' such as ``arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:270923740243:instance/78fb859d-1b7d-44b1-8aa3-12f0835c5855/queue/1d1a4575-9618-40ab-bbeb-81e45795fe61`` . The queue ID is also included in the URL, and is the string after 'queue/'.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Queues=string,string,Channels=string,string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "Queues": ["string", ...],
    "Channels": ["VOICE", ...]
  }



``--groupings`` (list)


  The grouping applied to the metrics returned. For example, when grouped by QUEUE, the metrics returned apply to each queue rather than aggregated for all queues. If you group by CHANNEL, you should include a Channels filter. The only supported channel is VOICE.

   

  If no ``Grouping`` is included in the request, a summary of ``CurrentMetrics`` is returned. 

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...

  Where valid values are:
    QUEUE
    CHANNEL





``--current-metrics`` (list)


  A list of ``CurrentMetric`` objects for the metrics to retrieve. Each ``CurrentMetric`` includes a name of a metric to retrieve and the unit to use for it.

   

  The following metrics are available:

    AGENTS_AVAILABLE  

  Unit: COUNT

    AGENTS_ONLINE  

  Unit: COUNT

    AGENTS_ON_CALL  

  Unit: COUNT

    AGENTS_STAFFED  

  Unit: COUNT

    AGENTS_AFTER_CONTACT_WORK  

  Unit: COUNT

    AGENTS_NON_PRODUCTIVE  

  Unit: COUNT

    AGENTS_ERROR  

  Unit: COUNT

    CONTACTS_IN_QUEUE  

  Unit: COUNT

    OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE  

  Unit: SECONDS

    CONTACTS_SCHEDULED  

  Unit: COUNT

    



Shorthand Syntax::

    Name=string,Unit=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Name": "AGENTS_ONLINE"|"AGENTS_AVAILABLE"|"AGENTS_ON_CALL"|"AGENTS_NON_PRODUCTIVE"|"AGENTS_AFTER_CONTACT_WORK"|"AGENTS_ERROR"|"AGENTS_STAFFED"|"CONTACTS_IN_QUEUE"|"OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE"|"CONTACTS_SCHEDULED",
      "Unit": "SECONDS"|"COUNT"|"PERCENT"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--next-token`` (string)


  The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the previous response in the next request to retrieve the next set of results.

   

  The token expires after 5 minutes from the time it is created. Subsequent requests that use the `NextToken must use the same request parameters as the request that generated the token.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


   ``MaxResults`` indicates the maximum number of results to return per page in the response, between 1 and 100.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

NextToken -> (string)

  

  A string returned in the response. Use the value returned in the response as the value of the NextToken in a subsequent request to retrieve the next set of results.

   ``Dimensions`` is the resourceId specified in the ``Filters`` of the request. 

   

   ``Collections`` is a list of ``CurrentMetricData`` objects with corresponding values to the ``CurrentMetrics`` specified in the request.

   

  If no ``Grouping`` is specified in the request, ``Collections`` is a summary for the ``CurrentMetric`` returned.

        Metric -> (structure)

          

          The metric in a ``CurrentMetricData`` object.

          

          Name -> (string)
