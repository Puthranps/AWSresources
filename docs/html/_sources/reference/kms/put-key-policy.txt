===========
Description

Attaches a key policy to the specified customer master key (CMK). You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account.

 

For more information about key policies, see `Key Policies <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

``--key-id`` (string)


  A unique identifier for the customer master key (CMK).

   

  Specify the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK.

   

  For example:

   

   
  * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``   
   
  * Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``   
   

   

  To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey .

  

``--policy-name`` (string)


  The name of the key policy. The only valid value is ``default`` .

  

``--policy`` (string)


  The key policy to attach to the CMK.

   

  The key policy must meet the following criteria:

   

   
  * If you don't set ``BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck`` to true, the key policy must allow the principal that is making the ``PutKeyPolicy`` request to make a subsequent ``PutKeyPolicy`` request on the CMK. This reduces the risk that the CMK becomes unmanageable. For more information, refer to the scenario in the `Default Key Policy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam>`__ section of the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* . 
   
  * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to AWS KMS. When you create a new AWS principal (for example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy. The reason for this is that the new principal might not be immediately visible to AWS KMS. For more information, see `Changes that I make are not always immediately visible <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency>`__ in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide* . 
   

   

  The key policy size limit is 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes).

  

``--bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check`` | ``--no-bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check`` (boolean)


  A flag to indicate whether to bypass the key policy lockout safety check.

   

  .. warning::

     

    Setting this value to true increases the risk that the CMK becomes unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscriminately.

     

    For more information, refer to the scenario in the `Default Key Policy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam>`__ section in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

   

  Use this parameter only when you intend to prevent the principal that is making the request from making a subsequent ``PutKeyPolicy`` request on the CMK.

   

  The default value is false.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
