===========
Description
===========



Imports key material into an existing AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) that was created without key material. You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account. For more information about creating CMKs with no key material and then importing key material, see `Importing Key Material <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

 

Before using this operation, call  GetParametersForImport . Its response includes a public key and an import token. Use the public key to encrypt the key material. Then, submit the import token from the same ``GetParametersForImport`` response.

 

When calling this operation, you must specify the following values:

 

 
* The key ID or key ARN of a CMK with no key material. Its ``Origin`` must be ``EXTERNAL`` . To create a CMK with no key material, call  CreateKey and set the value of its ``Origin`` parameter to ``EXTERNAL`` . To get the ``Origin`` of a CMK, call  DescribeKey .) 
 
* The encrypted key material. To get the public key to encrypt the key material, call  GetParametersForImport . 
 
* The import token that  GetParametersForImport returned. This token and the public key used to encrypt the key material must have come from the same response. 
 
* Whether the key material expires and if so, when. If you set an expiration date, you can change it only by reimporting the same key material and specifying a new expiration date. If the key material expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material and the CMK becomes unusable. To use the CMK again, you must reimport the same key material. 
 

 

When this operation is successful, the CMK's key state changes from ``PendingImport`` to ``Enabled`` , and you can use the CMK. After you successfully import key material into a CMK, you can reimport the same key material into that CMK, but you cannot import different key material.

 

The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see `How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

=======
Options
=======

``--key-id`` (string)


  The identifier of the CMK to import the key material into. The CMK's ``Origin`` must be ``EXTERNAL`` .

   

  Specify the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK.

   

  For example:

   

   
  * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``   
   
  * Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``   
   

   

  To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey .

  

``--import-token`` (blob)


  The import token that you received in the response to a previous  GetParametersForImport request. It must be from the same response that contained the public key that you used to encrypt the key material.

  

``--encrypted-key-material`` (blob)


  The encrypted key material to import. It must be encrypted with the public key that you received in the response to a previous  GetParametersForImport request, using the wrapping algorithm that you specified in that request.

  

``--valid-to`` (timestamp)


  The time at which the imported key material expires. When the key material expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material and the CMK becomes unusable. You must omit this parameter when the ``ExpirationModel`` parameter is set to ``KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE`` . Otherwise it is required.

  

``--expiration-model`` (string)


  Specifies whether the key material expires. The default is ``KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES`` , in which case you must include the ``ValidTo`` parameter. When this parameter is set to ``KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE`` , you must omit the ``ValidTo`` parameter.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES``

  
  *   ``KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
