****************************
delete-imported-key-material
****************************



===========
Description
===========



Deletes key material that you previously imported. This operation makes the specified customer master key (CMK) unusable. For more information about importing key material into AWS KMS, see `Importing Key Material <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* . You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account.

 

When the specified CMK is in the ``PendingDeletion`` state, this operation does not change the CMK's state. Otherwise, it changes the CMK's state to ``PendingImport`` .

 

After you delete key material, you can use  ImportKeyMaterial to reimport the same key material into the CMK.

 

The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see `How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

Options

``--key-id`` (string)


  The identifier of the CMK whose key material to delete. The CMK's ``Origin`` must be ``EXTERNAL`` .

   

  Specify the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK.

   

  For example:

   

   
  * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``   
   
  * Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``   
   

   

  To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
