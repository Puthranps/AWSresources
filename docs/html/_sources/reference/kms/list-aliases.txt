===========
Description
===========



Gets a list of aliases in the caller's AWS account and region. You cannot list aliases in other accounts. For more information about aliases, see  CreateAlias .

 

By default, the ListAliases command returns all aliases in the account and region. To get only the aliases that point to a particular customer master key (CMK), use the ``KeyId`` parameter.

 

The ``ListAliases`` response can include aliases that you created and associated with your customer managed CMKs, and aliases that AWS created and associated with AWS managed CMKs in your account. You can recognize AWS aliases because their names have the format ``aws/<service-name>`` , such as ``aws/dynamodb`` .

 

The response might also include aliases that have no ``TargetKeyId`` field. These are predefined aliases that AWS has created but has not yet associated with a CMK. Aliases that AWS creates in your account, including predefined aliases, do not count against your `AWS KMS aliases limit <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/limits.html#aliases-limit>`__ .

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``list-aliases`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Aliases``

  [--key-id <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--key-id`` (string)


  Lists only aliases that refer to the specified CMK. The value of this parameter can be the ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a CMK in the caller's account and region. You cannot use an alias name or alias ARN in this value.

   

  This parameter is optional. If you omit it, ``ListAliases`` returns all aliases in the account and region.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output
======

Aliases -> (list)

  

  A list of aliases.

  

  (structure)

    

    Contains information about an alias.

    

    AliasName -> (string)

      

      String that contains the alias.

      

      

    AliasArn -> (string)

      

      String that contains the key ARN.

      

      

    TargetKeyId -> (string)

      

      String that contains the key identifier referred to by the alias.

      

      

    

  

NextMarker -> (string)

  

  When ``Truncated`` is true, this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent request.

  

  

Truncated -> (boolean)

  

  A flag that indicates whether there are more items in the list. When this value is true, the list in this response is truncated. To get more items, pass the value of the ``NextMarker`` element in this response to the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent request.
