===========
Description
===========



Removes the specified account from the organization.

 

The removed account becomes a stand-alone account that is not a member of any organization. It is no longer subject to any policies and is responsible for its own bill payments. The organization's master account is no longer charged for any expenses accrued by the member account after it is removed from the organization.

 

This operation can be called only from the organization's master account. Member accounts can remove themselves with  LeaveOrganization instead.

 

.. warning::

   

  You can remove an account from your organization only if the account is configured with the information required to operate as a standalone account. When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required of standalone accounts is *not* automatically collected. For an account that you want to make standalone, you must accept the End User License Agreement (EULA), choose a support plan, provide and verify the required contact information, and provide a current payment method. AWS uses the payment method to charge for any billable (not free tier) AWS activity that occurs while the account is not attached to an organization. To remove an account that does not yet have this information, you must sign in as the member account and follow the steps at `To leave an organization when all required account information has not yet been provided <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info>`__ in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .

Synopsis

::

    remove-account-from-organization
  --account-id <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--account-id`` (string)


  The unique identifier (ID) of the member account that you want to remove from the organization.

   

  The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ for an account ID string requires exactly 12 digits.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
