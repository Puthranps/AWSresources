*******************
disable-policy-type
*******************



===========
Description
===========



Disables an organizational control policy type in a root. A policy of a certain type can be attached to entities in a root only if that type is enabled in the root. After you perform this operation, you no longer can attach policies of the specified type to that root or to any organizational unit (OU) or account in that root. You can undo this by using the  EnablePolicyType operation.

 

This operation can be called only from the organization's master account.

 

.. note::

   

  If you disable a policy type for a root, it still shows as enabled for the organization if all features are enabled in that organization. Use  ListRoots to see the status of policy types for a specified root. Use  DescribeOrganization to see the status of policy types in the organization.

Synopsis

::

    disable-policy-type
  --root-id <value>
  --policy-type <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--root-id`` (string)


  The unique identifier (ID) of the root in which you want to disable a policy type. You can get the ID from the  ListRoots operation.

   

  The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ for a root ID string requires "r-" followed by from 4 to 32 lower-case letters or digits.

  

``--policy-type`` (string)


  The policy type that you want to disable in this root.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples
========

**To disable a policy type in a root**

The following example shows how to disable the service control policy (SCP) policy type in a root: ::

	aws organizations disable-policy-type --root-id r-examplerootid111 --policy-type SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

The output shows that the PolicyTypes response element no longer includes SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY: ::

	{
		"Root": {
			"PolicyTypes": [],
			"Name": "Root",
			"Id": "r-examplerootid111",
			"Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:root/o-exampleorgid/r-examplerootid111"
		}
	}

Output

Root -> (structure)

  

  A structure that shows the root with the updated list of enabled policy types.

  

  Id -> (string)

    

    The unique identifier (ID) for the root.

     

    The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ for a root ID string requires "r-" followed by from 4 to 32 lower-case letters or digits.

    

    

  Arn -> (string)

    

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the root.

     

    For more information about ARNs in Organizations, see `ARN Formats Supported by Organizations <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_permissions.html#orgs-permissions-arns>`__ in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .

    

    

  Name -> (string)

    

    The friendly name of the root.

     

    The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ that is used to validate this parameter is a string of any of the characters in the ASCII character range.

    

    

  PolicyTypes -> (list)

    

    The types of policies that are currently enabled for the root and therefore can be attached to the root or to its OUs or accounts.

     

    .. note::

       

      Even if a policy type is shown as available in the organization, you can separately enable and disable them at the root level by using  EnablePolicyType and  DisablePolicyType . Use  DescribeOrganization to see the availability of the policy types in that organization.

       

    

    (structure)

      

      Contains information about a policy type and its status in the associated root.

      

      Type -> (string)

        

        The name of the policy type.

        

        

      Status -> (string)

        

        The status of the policy type as it relates to the associated root. To attach a policy of the specified type to a root or to an OU or account in that root, it must be available in the organization and enabled for that root.
