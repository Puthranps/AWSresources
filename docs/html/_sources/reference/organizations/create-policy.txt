Synopsis

    create-policy
  --content <value>

=======
Options
=======

``--content`` (string)


  The policy content to add to the new policy. For example, if you create a `service control policy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html>`__ (SCP), this string must be JSON text that specifies the permissions that admins in attached accounts can delegate to their users, groups, and roles. For more information about the SCP syntax, see `Service Control Policy Syntax <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_reference_scp-syntax.html>`__ in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .

  

``--description`` (string)


  An optional description to assign to the policy.

  

``--name`` (string)


  The friendly name to assign to the policy.

   

  The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ that is used to validate this parameter is a string of any of the characters in the ASCII character range.

  

``--type`` (string)


  The type of policy to create.

   

  .. note::

     

    In the current release, the only type of policy that you can create is a service control policy (SCP).

     

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


========
Examples
========

**Example 1: To create a policy with a text source file for the JSON policy**

The following example shows you how to create an service control policy (SCP) named ``AllowAllS3Actions``. The policy contents are taken from a file on the local computer called ``policy.json``. ::

	aws organizations create-policy --content file://policy.json --name AllowAllS3Actions, --type SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY --description "Allows delegation of all S3 actions"
	
The output includes a policy object with details about the new policy: ::

	{
		"Policy": {
			"Content": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"s3:*\"],\"Resource\":[\"*\"]}]}",
			"PolicySummary": {
				"Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::o-exampleorgid:policy/service_control_policy/p-examplepolicyid111",
				"Description": "Allows delegation of all S3 actions",
				"Name": "AllowAllS3Actions",
				"Type":"SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY"
			}
		}
	}
	
**Example 2: To create a policy with a JSON policy as a parameter**

The following example shows you how to create the same SCP, this time by embedding the policy contents as a JSON string in the parameter. The string must be escaped with backslashes before the double quotes to ensure that they are treated as literals in the parameter, which itself is surrounded by double quotes: ::

	aws organizations create-policy --content "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"s3:*\"],\"Resource\":[\"*\"]}]}" --name AllowAllS3Actions --type SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY --description "Allows delegation of all S3 actions"
