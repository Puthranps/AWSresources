******************
leave-organization
******************



===========
Description
===========



Removes a member account from its parent organization. This version of the operation is performed by the account that wants to leave. To remove a member account as a user in the master account, use  RemoveAccountFromOrganization instead.

 

This operation can be called only from a member account in the organization.

 

.. warning::

   

   
  * The master account in an organization with all features enabled can set service control policies (SCPs) that can restrict what administrators of member accounts can do, including preventing them from successfully calling ``LeaveOrganization`` and leaving the organization.  
   
  * You can leave an organization as a member account only if the account is configured with the information required to operate as a standalone account. When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required of standalone accounts is *not* automatically collected. For each account that you want to make standalone, you must accept the End User License Agreement (EULA), choose a support plan, provide and verify the required contact information, and provide a current payment method. AWS uses the payment method to charge for any billable (not free tier) AWS activity that occurs while the account is not attached to an organization. Follow the steps at `To leave an organization when all required account information has not yet been provided <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info>`__ in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* . 
   
  * You can leave an organization only after you enable IAM user access to billing in your account. For more information, see `Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html#ControllingAccessWebsite-Activate>`__ in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide* .

  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

Options
=======

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
