list-aws-service-access-for-organization
****************************************



===========
Description
===========



Returns a list of the AWS services that you enabled to integrate with your organization. After a service on this list creates the resources that it requires for the integration, it can perform operations on your organization and its accounts.

 

For more information about integrating other services with AWS Organizations, including the list of services that currently work with Organizations, see `Integrating AWS Organizations with Other AWS Services <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html>`__ in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .

 

This operation can be called only from the organization's master account.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``list-aws-service-access-for-organization`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``EnabledServicePrincipals``

    list-aws-service-access-for-organization
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--starting-token <value>]
  [--page-size <value>]
  [--max-items <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

EnabledServicePrincipals -> (list)

  

  A list of the service principals for the services that are enabled to integrate with your organization. Each principal is a structure that includes the name and the date that it was enabled for integration with AWS Organizations.

  

  (structure)

    

    A structure that contains details of a service principal that is enabled to integrate with AWS Organizations.

    

    ServicePrincipal -> (string)

      

      The name of the service principal. This is typically in the form of a URL, such as: `` *servicename* .amazonaws.com`` .

      

      

    DateEnabled -> (timestamp)

      

      The date that the service principal was enabled for integration with AWS Organizations.

      

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  If present, this value indicates that there is more output available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back as ``null`` .
