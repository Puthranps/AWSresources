``--names`` (list)


  The names of the public or private images to describe.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--arns`` (list)


  The ARNs of the public, private, and shared images to describe.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--type`` (string)


  The type of image (public, private, or shared) to describe. 

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``PUBLIC``

  
  *   ``PRIVATE``

  
  *   ``SHARED``

  

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results. If this value is empty, only the first page is retrieved.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum size of each page of results.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
