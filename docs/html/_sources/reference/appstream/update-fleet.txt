    "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
    "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...]
  }



``--max-user-duration-in-seconds`` (integer)


  The maximum time that a streaming session can run, in seconds. Specify a value between 600 and 57600.

  

``--disconnect-timeout-in-seconds`` (integer)


  The time after disconnection when a session is considered to have ended, in seconds. If a user who was disconnected reconnects within this time interval, the user is connected to their previous session. Specify a value between 60 and 57600.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
