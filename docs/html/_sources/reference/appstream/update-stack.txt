``--redirect-url`` (string)


  The URL that users are redirected to after their streaming session ends.

    REDIRECT_URL
    FEEDBACK_URL
    THEME_NAME

``--application-settings`` (structure)


  The persistent application settings for users of a stack. When these settings are enabled, changes that users make to applications and Windows settings are automatically saved after each session and applied to the next session.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Enabled=boolean,SettingsGroup=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "Enabled": true|false,
    "SettingsGroup": "string"
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
