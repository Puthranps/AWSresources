=======
Options
=======

``--stack-name`` (string)


  The name of the stack. This value is case-sensitive.

  

``--fleet-name`` (string)


  The name of the fleet. This value is case-sensitive.

  

``--user-id`` (string)


  The user ID.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for this operation. If this value is null, it retrieves the first page.

  

``--limit`` (integer)


  The size of each page of results. The default value is 20 and the maximum value is 50.

  

``--authentication-type`` (string)


  The authentication method. Specify ``API`` for a user authenticated using a streaming URL or ``SAML`` for a SAML federated user. The default is to authenticate users using a streaming URL.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``API``

  
  *   ``SAML``

  
  *   ``USERPOOL``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
