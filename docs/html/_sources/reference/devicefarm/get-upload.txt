Synopsis

::

    get-upload
  --arn <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--arn`` (string)


  The upload's ARN.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples

**Viewing an upload**

The following command retrieves information about an upload::

  aws devicefarm get-upload --arn "arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2:123456789012:upload:070fc3ca-7ec1-4741-9c1f-d3e044efc506/dd72723a-ae9e-4087-09e6-f4cea3599514"

You can get the upload ARN from the output of ``create-upload``.

Output::

  {
      "upload": {
          "status": "SUCCEEDED",
          "name": "app.apk",
          "created": 1505262773.186,
          "type": "ANDROID_APP",
          "arn": "arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2:123456789012:upload:070fc3ca-7ec1-4741-9c1f-d3e044efc506/dd72723a-ae9e-4087-09e6-f4cea3599514",
          "metadata": "{\"device_admin\":false,\"activity_name\":\"ccom.example.client.LauncherActivity\",\"version_name\":\"1.0.2.94\",\"screens\":[\"small\",\"normal\",\"large\",\"xlarge\"],\"error_type\":null,\"sdk_version\":\"16\",\"package_name\":\"com.example.client\",\"version_code\":\"20994\",\"native_code\":[\"armeabi-v7a\"],\"target_sdk_version\":\"25\"}"
