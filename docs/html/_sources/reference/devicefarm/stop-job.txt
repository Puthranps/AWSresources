********
stop-job
********



===========
Description
===========



Initiates a stop request for the current job. AWS Device Farm will immediately stop the job on the device where tests have not started executing, and you will not be billed for this device. On the device where tests have started executing, Setup Suite and Teardown Suite tests will run to completion before stopping execution on the device. You will be billed for Setup, Teardown, and any tests that were in progress or already completed.

Synopsis

::

    stop-job
  --arn <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--arn`` (string)


  Represents the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Device Farm job you wish to stop.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
