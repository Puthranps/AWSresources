=======
Options
=======

``--project-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project for which you want to create a remote access session.

  

``--device-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device for which you want to create a remote access session.

  

``--instance-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device instance for which you want to create a remote access session.

  

``--ssh-public-key`` (string)


  The public key of the ``ssh`` key pair you want to use for connecting to remote devices in your remote debugging session. This is only required if ``remoteDebugEnabled`` is set to ``true`` .

  

``--remote-debug-enabled`` | ``--no-remote-debug-enabled`` (boolean)


  Set to ``true`` if you want to access devices remotely for debugging in your remote access session.

  

``--remote-record-enabled`` | ``--no-remote-record-enabled`` (boolean)


  Set to ``true`` to enable remote recording for the remote access session.

  

``--remote-record-app-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the app to be recorded in the remote access session.

  

``--name`` (string)


  The name of the remote access session that you wish to create.

  

``--client-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for the client. If you want access to multiple devices on the same client, you should pass the same ``clientId`` value in each call to ``CreateRemoteAccessSession`` . This is required only if ``remoteDebugEnabled`` is set to ``true`` .

  

``--configuration`` (structure)


  The configuration information for the remote access session request.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    billingMethod=string,vpceConfigurationArns=string,string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "billingMethod": "METERED"|"UNMETERED",
    "vpceConfigurationArns": ["string", ...]
  }



``--interaction-mode`` (string)


  The interaction mode of the remote access session. Valid values are:

   

   
  * INTERACTIVE: You can interact with the iOS device by viewing, touching, and rotating the screen. You **cannot** run XCUITest framework-based tests in this mode. 
   
  * NO_VIDEO: You are connected to the device but cannot interact with it or view the screen. This mode has the fastest test execution speed. You **can** run XCUITest framework-based tests in this mode. 
   
  * VIDEO_ONLY: You can view the screen but cannot touch or rotate it. You **can** run XCUITest framework-based tests and watch the screen in this mode. 
   

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``INTERACTIVE``

  
  *   ``NO_VIDEO``

  
  *   ``VIDEO_ONLY``

  

  

``--skip-app-resign`` | ``--no-skip-app-resign`` (boolean)


  When set to ``true`` , for private devices, Device Farm will not sign your app again. For public devices, Device Farm always signs your apps again and this parameter has no effect.

   

  For more information about how Device Farm re-signs your app(s), see `Do you modify my app? <https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/faq/>`__ in the *AWS Device Farm FAQs* .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
