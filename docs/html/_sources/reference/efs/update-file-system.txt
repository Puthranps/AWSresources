===========
Description
===========



Updates the throughput mode or the amount of provisioned throughput of an existing file system.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/elasticfilesystem-2015-02-01/UpdateFileSystem>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis

::

    update-file-system
  --file-system-id <value>
  [--throughput-mode <value>]
  [--provisioned-throughput-in-mibps <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--file-system-id`` (string)


  The ID of the file system that you want to update.

  

``--throughput-mode`` (string)


  (Optional) The throughput mode that you want your file system to use. If you're not updating your throughput mode, you don't need to provide this value in your request.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``bursting``

  
  *   ``provisioned``

  

  

``--provisioned-throughput-in-mibps`` (double)


  (Optional) The amount of throughput, in MiB/s, that you want to provision for your file system. If you're not updating the amount of provisioned throughput for your file system, you don't need to provide this value in your request.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

OwnerId -> (string)

  

  AWS account that created the file system. If the file system was created by an IAM user, the parent account to which the user belongs is the owner.

  

  

CreationToken -> (string)

  

  Opaque string specified in the request.

  

  

FileSystemId -> (string)

  

  ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon EFS.

  

  

CreationTime -> (timestamp)

  

  Time that the file system was created, in seconds (since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

  

  

LifeCycleState -> (string)

  

  Lifecycle phase of the file system.

  

  

Name -> (string)

  

  You can add tags to a file system, including a ``Name`` tag. For more information, see  CreateTags . If the file system has a ``Name`` tag, Amazon EFS returns the value in this field. 

  

  

NumberOfMountTargets -> (integer)

  

  Current number of mount targets that the file system has. For more information, see  CreateMountTarget .

  

  

SizeInBytes -> (structure)

  

  Latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system, in its ``Value`` field, and the time at which that size was determined in its ``Timestamp`` field. The ``Timestamp`` value is the integer number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. The ``SizeInBytes`` value doesn't represent the size of a consistent snapshot of the file system, but it is eventually consistent when there are no writes to the file system. That is, ``SizeInBytes`` represents actual size only if the file system is not modified for a period longer than a couple of hours. Otherwise, the value is not the exact size that the file system was at any point in time. 

  

  Value -> (long)

    

    Latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system.

    

    

  Timestamp -> (timestamp)

    

    Time at which the size of data, returned in the ``Value`` field, was determined. The value is the integer number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

    

    

  

PerformanceMode -> (string)

  

  The ``PerformanceMode`` of the file system.

  

  

Encrypted -> (boolean)

  

  A Boolean value that, if true, indicates that the file system is encrypted.

  

  

KmsKeyId -> (string)

  

  The ID of an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) that was used to protect the encrypted file system.

  

  

ThroughputMode -> (string)

  

  The throughput mode for a file system. There are two throughput modes to choose from for your file system: bursting and provisioned. You can decrease your file system's throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or change between the throughput modes as long as itâ€™s been more than 24 hours since the last decrease or throughput mode change.

  

  

ProvisionedThroughputInMibps -> (double)

  

  The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for a file system. The limit on throughput is 1024 MiB/s. You can get these limits increased by contacting AWS Support. For more information, see `Amazon EFS Limits That You Can Increase <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/limits.html#soft-limits>`__ in the *Amazon EFS User Guide.*
