*****************
disassociate-node
*****************



===========
Description
===========



Disassociates a node from an AWS OpsWorks CM server, and removes the node from the server's managed nodes. After a node is disassociated, the node key pair is no longer valid for accessing the configuration manager's API. For more information about how to associate a node, see  AssociateNode . 

 

A node can can only be disassociated from a server that is in a ``HEALTHY`` state. Otherwise, an ``InvalidStateException`` is thrown. A ``ResourceNotFoundException`` is thrown when the server does not exist. A ``ValidationException`` is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.

Options
=======

``--server-name`` (string)


  The name of the server from which to disassociate the node. 

  

``--node-name`` (string)


  The name of the client node. 

  

``--engine-attributes`` (list)


  Engine attributes that are used for disassociating the node. No attributes are required for Puppet. 

   

   **Attributes required in a DisassociateNode request for Chef**

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


========
Examples
========

**To disassociate nodes**

The following ``disassociate-node`` command disassociates a node named ``i-44de882p``, removing the node from
management by a Chef Automate server named ``automate-06``. Valid node names are EC2 instance IDs.::

  aws opsworks-cm disassociate-node --server-name "automate-06" --node-name "i-43de882p" --engine-attributes "Name=CHEF_ORGANIZATION,Value='MyOrganization' Name=CHEF_NODE_PUBLIC_KEY,Value='Public_key_contents'"

The output returned by the command resembles the following.
*Output*::

  {
   "NodeAssociationStatusToken": "AHUY8wFe4pdXtZC5DiJa5SOLp5o14DH//rHRqHDWXxwVoNBxcEy4V7R0NOFymh7E/1HumOBPsemPQFE6dcGaiFk"
  }
