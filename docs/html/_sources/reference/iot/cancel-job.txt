Synopsis

::

  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--job-id`` (string)


  The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.

  

``--comment`` (string)


  An optional comment string describing why the job was canceled.

  

``--force`` | ``--no-force`` (boolean)


  (Optional) If ``true`` job executions with status "IN_PROGRESS" and "QUEUED" are canceled, otherwise only job executions with status "QUEUED" are canceled. The default is ``false`` .

   

  Canceling a job which is "IN_PROGRESS", will cause a device which is executing the job to be unable to update the job execution status. Use caution and ensure that each device executing a job which is canceled is able to recover to a valid state.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
