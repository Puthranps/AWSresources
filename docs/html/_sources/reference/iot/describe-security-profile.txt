``--security-profile-name`` (string)


  The name of the security profile whose information you want to get.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

securityProfileName -> (string)

  

  The name of the security profile.

  

  

securityProfileArn -> (string)

  

  The ARN of the security profile.

  

  

securityProfileDescription -> (string)

  

  A description of the security profile (associated with the security profile when it was created or updated).

  

  

behaviors -> (list)

  

  Specifies the behaviors that, when violated by a device (thing), cause an alert.

  

  (structure)

    

    A Device Defender security profile behavior.

    

    name -> (string)

      

      The name you have given to the behavior.

      

      

    metric -> (string)

      

      What is measured by the behavior.

      

      

    criteria -> (structure)

      

      The criteria that determine if a device is behaving normally in regard to the ``metric`` .

      

      comparisonOperator -> (string)

        

        The operator that relates the thing measured (``metric`` ) to the criteria (``value`` ).

        

        

      value -> (structure)

        

        The value to be compared with the ``metric`` .

        

        count -> (long)

          

          If the ``comparisonOperator`` calls for a numeric value, use this to specify that numeric value to be compared with the ``metric`` .

          

          

        cidrs -> (list)

          

          If the ``comparisonOperator`` calls for a set of CIDRs, use this to specify that set to be compared with the ``metric`` .

          

          (string)

            

            

          

        ports -> (list)

      durationSeconds -> (integer)

        

        Use this to specify the period of time over which the behavior is evaluated, for those criteria which have a time dimension (for example, ``NUM_MESSAGES_SENT`` ).

        

        

      

    

  

alertTargets -> (map)

  

  Where the alerts are sent. (Alerts are always sent to the console.)

  

  key -> (string)

    

    The type of alert target: one of "SNS".

    

    

  value -> (structure)

    

    A structure containing the alert target ARN and the role ARN.
