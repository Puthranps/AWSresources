===========
Description
===========



Lists the Device Defender security profile violations discovered during the given time period. You can use filters to limit the results to those alerts issued for a particular security profile, behavior or thing (device).

=======
Options
=======

``--start-time`` (timestamp)


  The start time for the alerts to be listed.

  

``--end-time`` (timestamp)


  The end time for the alerts to be listed.

  

``--thing-name`` (string)


  A filter to limit results to those alerts caused by the specified thing.

  

``--security-profile-name`` (string)


  A filter to limit results to those alerts generated by the specified security profile.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token for the next set of results.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to return at one time.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

violationEvents -> (list)

  

  The security profile violation alerts issued for this account during the given time frame, potentially filtered by security profile, behavior violated, or thing (device) violating.

  

  (structure)

    

    Information about a Device Defender security profile behavior violation.

    

    violationId -> (string)

      

      The ID of the violation event.

      

      

    thingName -> (string)

      

      The name of the thing responsible for the violation event.

      

      

    securityProfileName -> (string)

      

      The name of the security profile whose behavior was violated.

      

      

    behavior -> (structure)

      

      The behavior which was violated.

      

      name -> (string)

        

        The name you have given to the behavior.

        

        

      metric -> (string)

        

        What is measured by the behavior.

        

        

      criteria -> (structure)

        

        The criteria that determine if a device is behaving normally in regard to the ``metric`` .

        

        comparisonOperator -> (string)

          

          The operator that relates the thing measured (``metric`` ) to the criteria (``value`` ).

          

          

        value -> (structure)

          count -> (long)

            

            If the ``comparisonOperator`` calls for a numeric value, use this to specify that numeric value to be compared with the ``metric`` .

            

            

          cidrs -> (list)

    metricValue -> (structure)

      

      The value of the metric (the measurement).
