=======
Options
=======

``--start-time`` (timestamp)


  The beginning of the time period. Note that audit information is retained for a limited time (180 days). Requesting a start time prior to what is retained results in an "InvalidRequestException".

  

``--end-time`` (timestamp)


  The end of the time period.

  

``--task-type`` (string)


  A filter to limit the output to the specified type of audit: can be one of "ON_DEMAND_AUDIT_TASK" or "SCHEDULED__AUDIT_TASK".

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``ON_DEMAND_AUDIT_TASK``

  
  *   ``SCHEDULED_AUDIT_TASK``

  

  

``--task-status`` (string)


  A filter to limit the output to audits with the specified completion status: can be one of "IN_PROGRESS", "COMPLETED", "FAILED" or "CANCELED".

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``IN_PROGRESS``

  
  *   ``COMPLETED``

  
  *   ``FAILED``

  
  *   ``CANCELED``

  

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token for the next set of results.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to return at one time. The default is 25.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
