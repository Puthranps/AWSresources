=======
Options
=======

``--thing-name`` (string)


  The thing name.

  

``--status`` (string)


  An optional filter that lets you search for jobs that have the specified status.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``QUEUED``

  
  *   ``IN_PROGRESS``

  
  *   ``SUCCEEDED``

  
  *   ``FAILED``

  
  *   ``TIMED_OUT``

  
  *   ``REJECTED``

  
  *   ``REMOVED``

  
  *   ``CANCELED``

  

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to be returned per request.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token to retrieve the next set of results.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
