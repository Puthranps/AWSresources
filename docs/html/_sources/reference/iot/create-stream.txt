===========
Description
===========



Creates a stream for delivering one or more large files in chunks over MQTT. A stream transports data bytes in chunks or blocks packaged as MQTT messages from a source like S3. You can have one or more files associated with a stream. The total size of a file associated with the stream cannot exceed more than 2 MB. The stream will be created with version 0. If a stream is created with the same streamID as a stream that existed and was deleted within last 90 days, we will resurrect that old stream by incrementing the version by 1.

Shorthand Syntax::

    fileId=integer,s3Location={bucket=string,key=string,version=string} ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "fileId": integer,
      "s3Location": {
        "bucket": "string",
        "key": "string",
        "version": "string"
      }
    }
    ...
  ]



``--role-arn`` (string)


  An IAM role that allows the IoT service principal assumes to access your S3 files.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
