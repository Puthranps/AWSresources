=======
Options

``--security-profile-name`` (string)


  The name of the security profile you want to update.

  

``--security-profile-description`` (string)


  A description of the security profile.

  

``--behaviors`` (list)


  Specifies the behaviors that, when violated by a device (thing), cause an alert.

  



JSON Syntax::

      "name": "string",
      "metric": "string",
      "criteria": {
        "comparisonOperator": "less-than"|"less-than-equals"|"greater-than"|"greater-than-equals"|"in-cidr-set"|"not-in-cidr-set"|"in-port-set"|"not-in-port-set",

        },
        "durationSeconds": integer
      }
    }
    ...
  ]



``--alert-targets`` (map)


  Where the alerts are sent. (Alerts are always sent to the console.)

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    KeyName1=alertTargetArn=string,roleArn=string,KeyName2=alertTargetArn=string,roleArn=string
  
  Where valid key names are:
    SNS




JSON Syntax::

  {"SNS": {
        "alertTargetArn": "string",
        "roleArn": "string"
      }
    ...}



``--expected-version`` (long)


  The expected version of the security profile. A new version is generated whenever the security profile is updated. If you specify a value that is different than the actual version, a ``VersionConflictException`` is thrown.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

behaviors -> (list)

  

  Specifies the behaviors that, when violated by a device (thing), cause an alert.

  

  (structure)

      The name you have given to the behavior.

      

      

    metric -> (string)

      

      What is measured by the behavior.

      

      

    criteria -> (structure)

      

      The criteria that determine if a device is behaving normally in regard to the ``metric`` .

      

      comparisonOperator -> (string)

          If the ``comparisonOperator`` calls for a numeric value, use this to specify that numeric value to be compared with the ``metric`` .

          

          

        cidrs -> (list)

alertTargets -> (map)

  

  Where the alerts are sent. (Alerts are always sent to the console.)
