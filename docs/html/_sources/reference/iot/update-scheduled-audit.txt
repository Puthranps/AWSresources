Options

``--frequency`` (string)


  How often the scheduled audit takes place. Can be one of "DAILY", "WEEKLY", "BIWEEKLY" or "MONTHLY". The actual start time of each audit is determined by the system.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``DAILY``

  
  *   ``WEEKLY``

  
  *   ``BIWEEKLY``

  
  *   ``MONTHLY``

  

  

``--day-of-month`` (string)


  The day of the month on which the scheduled audit takes place. Can be "1" through "31" or "LAST". This field is required if the "frequency" parameter is set to "MONTHLY". If days 29-31 are specified, and the month does not have that many days, the audit takes place on the "LAST" day of the month.

  

``--day-of-week`` (string)


  The day of the week on which the scheduled audit takes place. Can be one of "SUN", "MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU", "FRI" or "SAT". This field is required if the "frequency" parameter is set to "WEEKLY" or "BIWEEKLY".

``--target-check-names`` (list)

``--scheduled-audit-name`` (string)


  The name of the scheduled audit. (Max. 128 chars)

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
