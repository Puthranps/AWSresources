=======
Options
=======

``--principal`` (string)


  The principal.

  

``--cognito-identity-pool-id`` (string)


  The Cognito identity pool ID.

  

``--auth-infos`` (list)


  A list of authorization info objects. Simulating authorization will create a response for each ``authInfo`` object in the list.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    actionType=string,resources=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "actionType": "PUBLISH"|"SUBSCRIBE"|"RECEIVE"|"CONNECT",
      "resources": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--client-id`` (string)


  The MQTT client ID.

  

``--policy-names-to-add`` (list)


  When testing custom authorization, the policies specified here are treated as if they are attached to the principal being authorized.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--policy-names-to-skip`` (list)


  When testing custom authorization, the policies specified here are treated as if they are not attached to the principal being authorized.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

authResults -> (list)

  

  The authentication results.

  

  (structure)

    

    The authorizer result.

    

    authInfo -> (structure)

      

      Authorization information.

      

      actionType -> (string)

        

        The type of action for which the principal is being authorized.

        

        

      resources -> (list)

        

        The resources for which the principal is being authorized to perform the specified action.

      policies -> (list)

        

        A list of policies that allowed the authentication.

        

        (structure)

          

          Describes an AWS IoT policy.

          

          policyName -> (string)
