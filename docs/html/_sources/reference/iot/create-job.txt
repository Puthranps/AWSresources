=======
Options
=======

``--job-id`` (string)


  A job identifier which must be unique for your AWS account. We recommend using a UUID. Alpha-numeric characters, "-" and "_" are valid for use here.

  

``--targets`` (list)


  A list of things and thing groups to which the job should be sent.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--document-source`` (string)


  An S3 link to the job document.

  

``--document`` (string)


  The job document.

  

``--description`` (string)


  A short text description of the job.

  

``--presigned-url-config`` (structure)


  Configuration information for pre-signed S3 URLs.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    roleArn=string,expiresInSec=long




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "roleArn": "string",
    "expiresInSec": long
  }



``--target-selection`` (string)


  Specifies whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or will be complete after all those things specified as targets have completed the job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the job may also be run on a thing when a change is detected in a target. For example, a job will run on a thing when the thing is added to a target group, even after the job was completed by all things originally in the group.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``CONTINUOUS``

  
  *   ``SNAPSHOT``

  

  

``--job-executions-rollout-config`` (structure)


  Allows you to create a staged rollout of the job.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    maximumPerMinute=integer




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "maximumPerMinute": integer
  }



``--timeout-config`` (structure)


  Specifies the amount of time each device has to finish its execution of the job. The timer is started when the job execution status is set to ``IN_PROGRESS`` . If the job execution status is not set to another terminal state before the time expires, it will be automatically set to ``TIMED_OUT`` .

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    inProgressTimeoutInMinutes=long




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "inProgressTimeoutInMinutes": long
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
