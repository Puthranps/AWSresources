*********************
create-policy-version
*********************



===========
Description
===========



Creates a new version of the specified AWS IoT policy. To update a policy, create a new policy version. A managed policy can have up to five versions. If the policy has five versions, you must use  DeletePolicyVersion to delete an existing version before you create a new one.

 

Optionally, you can set the new version as the policy's default version. The default version is the operative version (that is, the version that is in effect for the certificates to which the policy is attached).

Synopsis

::

    create-policy-version
  --policy-name <value>

  [--cli-input-json <value>]

Options
=======

``--policy-name`` (string)


  The policy name.

  

``--policy-document`` (string)


  The JSON document that describes the policy. Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048, excluding whitespace.

  

``--set-as-default`` | ``--no-set-as-default`` (boolean)


  Specifies whether the policy version is set as the default. When this parameter is true, the new policy version becomes the operative version (that is, the version that is in effect for the certificates to which the policy is attached).

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
