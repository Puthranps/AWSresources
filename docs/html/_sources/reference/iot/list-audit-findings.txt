=======
Options
=======

``--task-id`` (string)


  A filter to limit results to the audit with the specified ID. You must specify either the taskId or the startTime and endTime, but not both.

  

``--check-name`` (string)


  A filter to limit results to the findings for the specified audit check.

  

``--resource-identifier`` (structure)


  Information identifying the non-compliant resource.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    deviceCertificateId=string,caCertificateId=string,cognitoIdentityPoolId=string,clientId=string,policyVersionIdentifier={policyName=string,policyVersionId=string},account=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "deviceCertificateId": "string",
    "caCertificateId": "string",
    "cognitoIdentityPoolId": "string",
    "clientId": "string",
    "policyVersionIdentifier": {
      "policyName": "string",
      "policyVersionId": "string"
    },
    "account": "string"
  }



``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to return at one time. The default is 25.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token for the next set of results.

  

``--start-time`` (timestamp)


  A filter to limit results to those found after the specified time. You must specify either the startTime and endTime or the taskId, but not both.

  

``--end-time`` (timestamp)


  A filter to limit results to those found before the specified time. You must specify either the startTime and endTime or the taskId, but not both.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
