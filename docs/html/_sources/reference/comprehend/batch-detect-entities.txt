===========
Description

Inspects the text of a batch of documents for named entities and returns information about them. For more information about named entities, see  how-entities

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

=======
Options
=======

``--text-list`` (list)


  A list containing the text of the input documents. The list can contain a maximum of 25 documents. Each document must contain fewer than 5,000 bytes of UTF-8 encoded characters.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--language-code`` (string)


  The language of the input documents. You can specify English ("en") or Spanish ("es"). All documents must be in the same language.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``en``

  
  *   ``es``

  
  *   ``fr``

  
  *   ``de``

  
  *   ``it``

  
  *   ``pt``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

ResultList -> (list)

  

  A list of objects containing the results of the operation. The results are sorted in ascending order by the ``Index`` field and match the order of the documents in the input list. If all of the documents contain an error, the ``ResultList`` is empty.

  

  (structure)

    

    The result of calling the operation. The operation returns one object for each document that is successfully processed by the operation.

    

    Index -> (integer)

      

      The zero-based index of the document in the input list.

      

      

    Entities -> (list)

      

      One or more  Entity objects, one for each entity detected in the document.

      

      (structure)

        

        Provides information about an entity. 

         

         

        

        Score -> (float)

          

          The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the accuracy of the detection.

          

          

        Type -> (string)

          

          The entity's type.

          

          

        Text -> (string)

          

          The text of the entity.

          

          

        BeginOffset -> (integer)

          

          A character offset in the input text that shows where the entity begins (the first character is at position 0). The offset returns the position of each UTF-8 code point in the string. A *code point* is the abstract character from a particular graphical representation. For example, a multi-byte UTF-8 character maps to a single code point.

          

          

        EndOffset -> (integer)

          

          A character offset in the input text that shows where the entity ends. The offset returns the position of each UTF-8 code point in the string. A *code point* is the abstract character from a particular graphical representation. For example, a multi-byte UTF-8 character maps to a single code point. 

          

          

        

      

    

  

ErrorList -> (list)

  

  A list containing one object for each document that contained an error. The results are sorted in ascending order by the ``Index`` field and match the order of the documents in the input list. If there are no errors in the batch, the ``ErrorList`` is empty.

  

  (structure)

    

    Describes an error that occurred while processing a document in a batch. The operation returns on ``BatchItemError`` object for each document that contained an error.

    

    Index -> (integer)

      

      The zero-based index of the document in the input list.

      

      

    ErrorCode -> (string)

      

      The numeric error code of the error.

      

      

    ErrorMessage -> (string)

      

      A text description of the error.
