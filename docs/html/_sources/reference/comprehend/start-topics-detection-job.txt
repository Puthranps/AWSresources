``--data-access-role-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that grants Amazon Comprehend read access to your input data. For more information, see `https\://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/access-control-managing-permissions.html#auth-role-permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/access-control-managing-permissions.html#auth-role-permissions>`__ .

  

``--job-name`` (string)


  The identifier of the job.

  

``--number-of-topics`` (integer)


  The number of topics to detect.

  

``--client-request-token`` (string)


  A unique identifier for the request. If you do not set the client request token, Amazon Comprehend generates one.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
