=======
Options
=======

``--text`` (string)


  A UTF-8 text string. Each string must contain fewer that 5,000 bytes of UTF-8 encoded characters.

  

``--language-code`` (string)


  The language of the input documents. You can specify English ("en") or Spanish ("es"). All documents must be in the same language.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``en``

  
  *   ``es``

  
  *   ``fr``

  
  *   ``de``

  
  *   ``it``

  
  *   ``pt``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Output
======

Entities -> (list)

  

  A collection of entities identified in the input text. For each entity, the response provides the entity text, entity type, where the entity text begins and ends, and the level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the detection. For a list of entity types, see  how-entities . 

  

  (structure)

    

    Provides information about an entity. 

     

     

    

    Score -> (float)

      

      The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the accuracy of the detection.

      

      

    Type -> (string)

      

      The entity's type.

      

      

    Text -> (string)

      

      The text of the entity.

      

      

    BeginOffset -> (integer)

      

      A character offset in the input text that shows where the entity begins (the first character is at position 0). The offset returns the position of each UTF-8 code point in the string. A *code point* is the abstract character from a particular graphical representation. For example, a multi-byte UTF-8 character maps to a single code point.

      

      

    EndOffset -> (integer)

      

      A character offset in the input text that shows where the entity ends. The offset returns the position of each UTF-8 code point in the string. A *code point* is the abstract character from a particular graphical representation. For example, a multi-byte UTF-8 character maps to a single code point.
