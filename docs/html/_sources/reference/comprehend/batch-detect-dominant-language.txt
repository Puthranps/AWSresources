===========
Description
===========



Determines the dominant language of the input text for a batch of documents. For a list of languages that Amazon Comprehend can detect, see `Amazon Comprehend Supported Languages <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-languages.html>`__ .

Options
=======

``--text-list`` (list)


  A list containing the text of the input documents. The list can contain a maximum of 25 documents. Each document should contain at least 20 characters and must contain fewer than 5,000 bytes of UTF-8 encoded characters.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

ResultList -> (list)

  

  A list of objects containing the results of the operation. The results are sorted in ascending order by the ``Index`` field and match the order of the documents in the input list. If all of the documents contain an error, the ``ResultList`` is empty.

  

  (structure)

    

    The result of calling the operation. The operation returns one object for each document that is successfully processed by the operation.

    

    Index -> (integer)

      

      The zero-based index of the document in the input list.

      

      

    Languages -> (list)

      

      One or more  DominantLanguage objects describing the dominant languages in the document.

      

      (structure)

        

        Returns the code for the dominant language in the input text and the level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the accuracy of the detection.

        

        LanguageCode -> (string)

          

          The RFC 5646 language code for the dominant language. For more information about RFC 5646, see `Tags for Identifying Languages <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646>`__ on the *IETF Tools* web site.

          

          

        Score -> (float)

          

          The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the accuracy of the detection.

          

          

        

      

    

  

ErrorList -> (list)

  

  A list containing one object for each document that contained an error. The results are sorted in ascending order by the ``Index`` field and match the order of the documents in the input list. If there are no errors in the batch, the ``ErrorList`` is empty.

  

  (structure)

    

    Describes an error that occurred while processing a document in a batch. The operation returns on ``BatchItemError`` object for each document that contained an error.

    

    Index -> (integer)

      

      The zero-based index of the document in the input list.

      

      

    ErrorCode -> (string)

      

      The numeric error code of the error.

      

      

    ErrorMessage -> (string)

      

      A text description of the error.
