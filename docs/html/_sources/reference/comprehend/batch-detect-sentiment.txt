Options
=======

``--text-list`` (list)


  A list containing the text of the input documents. The list can contain a maximum of 25 documents. Each document must contain fewer that 5,000 bytes of UTF-8 encoded characters.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--language-code`` (string)


  The language of the input documents. You can specify English ("en") or Spanish ("es"). All documents must be in the same language.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``en``

  
  *   ``es``

  
  *   ``fr``

  
  *   ``de``

  
  *   ``it``

  
  *   ``pt``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

  (structure)

    

    Describes an error that occurred while processing a document in a batch. The operation returns on ``BatchItemError`` object for each document that contained an error.

    

    Index -> (integer)

      

      The zero-based index of the document in the input list.

      

      

    ErrorCode -> (string)

      

      The numeric error code of the error.
