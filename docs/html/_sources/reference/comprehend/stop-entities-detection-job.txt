===========
Description
===========



Stops an entities detection job in progress.

 

If the job state is ``IN_PROGRESS`` the job is marked for termination and put into the ``STOP_REQUESTED`` state. If the job completes before it can be stopped, it is put into the ``COMPLETED`` state; otherwise the job is stopped and put into the ``STOPPED`` state.

 

If the job is in the ``COMPLETED`` or ``FAILED`` state when you call the ``StopDominantLanguageDetectionJob`` operation, the operation returns a 400 Internal Request Exception. 

 

When a job is stopped, any documents already processed are written to the output location.

``--job-id`` (string)


  The identifier of the entities detection job to stop.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
