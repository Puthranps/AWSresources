===========
Description
===========



Gets a list of the topic detection jobs that you have submitted.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/comprehend-2017-11-27/ListTopicsDetectionJobs>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``list-topics-detection-jobs`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``TopicsDetectionJobPropertiesList``

Options
=======

``--filter`` (structure)


  Filters the jobs that are returned. Jobs can be filtered on their name, status, or the date and time that they were submitted. You can set only one filter at a time.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    JobName=string,JobStatus=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "JobName": "string",
    "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"COMPLETED"|"FAILED"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED",
    "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
    "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

TopicsDetectionJobPropertiesList -> (list)

  

  A list containing the properties of each job that is returned.

  

  (structure)

    

    Provides information about a topic detection job.

    

    JobId -> (string)

      

      The identifier assigned to the topic detection job.

      

      

    JobName -> (string)

      

      The name of the topic detection job.

      

      

    JobStatus -> (string)

      

      The current status of the topic detection job. If the status is ``Failed`` , the reason for the failure is shown in the ``Message`` field.

      

      

    Message -> (string)

      

      A description for the status of a job.

      

      

    SubmitTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The time that the topic detection job was submitted for processing.

      

      

    EndTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The time that the topic detection job was completed.

      

      

    InputDataConfig -> (structure)

      

      The input data configuration supplied when you created the topic detection job.

      

      S3Uri -> (string)

        

        The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for a collection of data files. 

         

        For example, if you use the URI ``S3://bucketName/prefix`` , if the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

        

        

      InputFormat -> (string)

        

        Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

         

         
        * ``ONE_DOC_PER_FILE`` - Each file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing large documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers. 
         
        * ``ONE_DOC_PER_LINE`` - Each line in a file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing many short documents, such as text messages. 
         

        

        

      

    OutputDataConfig -> (structure)

      

      The output data configuration supplied when you created the topic detection job.

      

      S3Uri -> (string)

        

        When you use the ``OutputDataConfig`` object with asynchronous operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want to write the output data. The URI must be in the same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The location is used as the prefix for the actual location of the output file.

         

        When the topic detection job is finished, the service creates an output file in a directory specific to the job. The ``S3Uri`` field contains the location of the output file, called ``output.tar.gz`` . It is a compressed archive that contains the ouput of the operation.

        

        

      

    NumberOfTopics -> (integer)

      

      The number of topics to detect supplied when you created the topic detection job. The default is 10. 

      

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  Identifies the next page of results to return.
