Synopsis

    detect-syntax
  --text <value>
  --language-code <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--text`` (string)


  A UTF-8 string. Each string must contain fewer that 5,000 bytes of UTF encoded characters.

  

``--language-code`` (string)


  The language code of the input documents. You can specify English ("en") or Spanish ("es").

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``en``

  
  *   ``es``

  
  *   ``fr``

  
  *   ``de``

  
  *   ``it``

  
  *   ``pt``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Output
======

SyntaxTokens -> (list)

  

  A collection of syntax tokens describing the text. For each token, the response provides the text, the token type, where the text begins and ends, and the level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has that the token is correct. For a list of token types, see  how-syntax .

  

  (structure)

    

    Represents a work in the input text that was recognized and assigned a part of speech. There is one syntax token record for each word in the source text.

    

    TokenId -> (integer)

      

      A unique identifier for a token.

      

      

    Text -> (string)

      

      The word that was recognized in the source text.

      

      

    BeginOffset -> (integer)

      

      The zero-based offset from the beginning of the source text to the first character in the word.

      

      

    EndOffset -> (integer)

      

      The zero-based offset from the beginning of the source text to the last character in the word.

      

      

    PartOfSpeech -> (structure)

      

      Provides the part of speech label and the confidence level that Amazon Comprehend has that the part of speech was correctly identified. For more information, see  how-syntax .

      

      Tag -> (string)

        

        Identifies the part of speech that the token represents.

        

        

      Score -> (float)

        

        The confidence that Amazon Comprehend has that the part of speech was correctly identified.
