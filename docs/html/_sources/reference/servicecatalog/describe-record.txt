Options
=======

``--accept-language`` (string)


  The language code.

   

   
  * ``en`` - English (default) 
   
  * ``jp`` - Japanese 
   
  * ``zh`` - Chinese 
   

  

``--id`` (string)


  The record identifier of the provisioned product. This identifier is returned by the request operation.

  

``--page-token`` (string)


  The page token for the next set of results. To retrieve the first set of results, use null.

  

``--page-size`` (integer)


  The maximum number of items to return with this call.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
