=======
Options
=======

``--accept-language`` (string)


  The language code.

   

   
  * ``en`` - English (default) 
   
  * ``jp`` - Japanese 
   
  * ``zh`` - Chinese 
   

  

``--access-level-filter`` (structure)


  The access level to use to obtain results. The default is ``User`` .

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Key=string,Value=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "Key": "Account"|"Role"|"User",
    "Value": "string"
  }



``--filters`` (map)


  The search filters.

   

  When the key is ``SearchQuery`` , the searchable fields are ``arn`` , ``createdTime`` , ``id`` , ``lastRecordId`` , ``idempotencyToken`` , ``name`` , ``physicalId`` , ``productId`` , ``provisioningArtifact`` , ``type`` , ``status`` , ``tags`` , ``userArn`` , and ``userArnSession`` .

   

  Example: ``"SearchQuery":["status:AVAILABLE"]``  

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string
  
  Where valid key names are:
    SearchQuery




JSON Syntax::

  {"SearchQuery": ["string", ...]
    ...}



``--sort-by`` (string)


  The sort field. If no value is specified, the results are not sorted. The valid values are ``arn`` , ``id`` , ``name`` , and ``lastRecordId`` .

  

``--sort-order`` (string)


  The sort order. If no value is specified, the results are not sorted.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``ASCENDING``

  
  *   ``DESCENDING``

  

  

``--page-size`` (integer)


  The maximum number of items to return with this call.

  

``--page-token`` (string)


  The page token for the next set of results. To retrieve the first set of results, use null.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

ProvisionedProducts -> (list)

  

  Information about the provisioned products.

  

  (structure)

    

    Information about a provisioned product.

    

    Name -> (string)

      

      The user-friendly name of the provisioned product.

      

      

    Arn -> (string)

      

      The ARN of the provisioned product.

      

      

    Type -> (string)

      

      The type of provisioned product. The supported value is ``CFN_STACK`` .

      

      

    Id -> (string)

      

      The identifier of the provisioned product.

      

      

    Status -> (string)

      

      The current status of the provisioned product.

       

       
      * ``AVAILABLE`` - Stable state, ready to perform any operation. The most recent operation succeeded and completed. 
       
      * ``UNDER_CHANGE`` - Transitive state, operations performed might not have valid results. Wait for an ``AVAILABLE`` status before performing operations. 
       
      * ``TAINTED`` - Stable state, ready to perform any operation. The stack has completed the requested operation but is not exactly what was requested. For example, a request to update to a new version failed and the stack rolled back to the current version. 
       
      * ``ERROR`` - An unexpected error occurred, the provisioned product exists but the stack is not running. For example, CloudFormation received a parameter value that was not valid and could not launch the stack. 
       

      

      

    StatusMessage -> (string)

      

      The current status message of the provisioned product.

    IdempotencyToken -> (string)

      

      A unique identifier that you provide to ensure idempotency. If multiple requests differ only by the idempotency token, the same response is returned for each repeated request.

      One or more tags.

      

      (structure)

        Key -> (string)

          

          The tag key.

    UserArnSession -> (string)

      

      The ARN of the IAM user in the session. This ARN might contain a session ID.

      

      

    

  

TotalResultsCount -> (integer)

  

  The number of provisioned products found.

  

  

NextPageToken -> (string)

  

  The page token to use to retrieve the next set of results. If there are no additional results, this value is null.
