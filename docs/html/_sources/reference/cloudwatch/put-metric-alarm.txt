put-metric-alarm

===========
Description
===========



Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with the specified metric. Optionally, this operation can associate one or more Amazon SNS resources with the alarm.

 

When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` . The alarm is evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the state are then executed.

 

When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

 

If you are an IAM user, you must have Amazon EC2 permissions for some operations:

 

 
* ``iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`` for all alarms with EC2 actions 
 
* ``ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus`` and ``ec2:DescribeInstances`` for all alarms on EC2 instance status metrics 
 
* ``ec2:StopInstances`` for alarms with stop actions 
 
* ``ec2:TerminateInstances`` for alarms with terminate actions 
 
* ``ec2:DescribeInstanceRecoveryAttribute`` and ``ec2:RecoverInstances`` for alarms with recover actions 
 

 

If you have read/write permissions for Amazon CloudWatch but not for Amazon EC2, you can still create an alarm, but the stop or terminate actions are not performed. However, if you are later granted the required permissions, the alarm actions that you created earlier are performed.

 

If you are using an IAM role (for example, an EC2 instance profile), you cannot stop or terminate the instance using alarm actions. However, you can still see the alarm state and perform any other actions such as Amazon SNS notifications or Auto Scaling policies.

 

If you are using temporary security credentials granted using AWS STS, you cannot stop or terminate an EC2 instance using alarm actions.

 

The first time you create an alarm in the AWS Management Console, the CLI, or by using the PutMetricAlarm API, CloudWatch creates the necessary service-linked role for you. The service-linked role is called ``AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents`` . For more information about service-linked roles, see `AWS service-linked role <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role>`__ .

``--metric-name`` (string)


  The name for the metric associated with the alarm.

  

``--namespace`` (string)


  The namespace for the metric associated with the alarm.

  

``--statistic`` (string)


  The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm, other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use ``ExtendedStatistic`` . When you call ``PutMetricAlarm`` , you must specify either ``Statistic`` or ``ExtendedStatistic,`` but not both.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``SampleCount``

  
  *   ``Average``

  
  *   ``Sum``

  
  *   ``Minimum``

  
  *   ``Maximum``

  

  

``--extended-statistic`` (string)


  The percentile statistic for the metric associated with the alarm. Specify a value between p0.0 and p100. When you call ``PutMetricAlarm`` , you must specify either ``Statistic`` or ``ExtendedStatistic,`` but not both.

  

``--dimensions`` (list)


  The dimensions for the metric associated with the alarm.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Name=string,Value=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Name": "string",
      "Value": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--period`` (integer)


  The period, in seconds, over which the specified statistic is applied. Valid values are 10, 30, and any multiple of 60.

   

  Be sure to specify 10 or 30 only for metrics that are stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call with a ``StorageResolution`` of 1. If you specify a period of 10 or 30 for a metric that does not have sub-minute resolution, the alarm still attempts to gather data at the period rate that you specify. In this case, it does not receive data for the attempts that do not correspond to a one-minute data resolution, and the alarm may often lapse into INSUFFICENT_DATA status. Specifying 10 or 30 also sets this alarm as a high-resolution alarm, which has a higher charge than other alarms. For more information about pricing, see `Amazon CloudWatch Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/>`__ .

   

  An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one day, so ``Period`` multiplied by ``EvaluationPeriods`` cannot be more than 86,400 seconds.

  

``--unit`` (string)


  The unit of measure for the statistic. For example, the units for the Amazon EC2 NetworkIn metric are Bytes because NetworkIn tracks the number of bytes that an instance receives on all network interfaces. You can also specify a unit when you create a custom metric. Units help provide conceptual meaning to your data. Metric data points that specify a unit of measure, such as Percent, are aggregated separately.

   

  If you specify a unit, you must use a unit that is appropriate for the metric. Otherwise, the CloudWatch alarm can get stuck in the ``INSUFFICIENT DATA`` state. 

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``Seconds``

  
  *   ``Microseconds``

  
  *   ``Milliseconds``

  
  *   ``Bytes``

  
  *   ``Kilobytes``

  
  *   ``Megabytes``

  
  *   ``Gigabytes``

  
  *   ``Terabytes``

  
  *   ``Bits``

  
  *   ``Kilobits``

  
  *   ``Megabits``

  
  *   ``Gigabits``

  
  *   ``Terabits``

  
  *   ``Percent``

  
  *   ``Count``

  
  *   ``Bytes/Second``

  
  *   ``Kilobytes/Second``

  
  *   ``Megabytes/Second``

  
  *   ``Gigabytes/Second``

  
  *   ``Terabytes/Second``

  
  *   ``Bits/Second``

  
  *   ``Kilobits/Second``

  
  *   ``Megabits/Second``

  
  *   ``Gigabits/Second``

  
  *   ``Terabits/Second``

  
  *   ``Count/Second``

  
  *   ``None``

  

  

``--evaluation-periods`` (integer)


  The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold. If you are setting an alarm which requires that a number of consecutive data points be breaching to trigger the alarm, this value specifies that number. If you are setting an "M out of N" alarm, this value is the N.

   

  An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one day, so this number multiplied by ``Period`` cannot be more than 86,400 seconds.

  

``--datapoints-to-alarm`` (integer)


  The number of datapoints that must be breaching to trigger the alarm. This is used only if you are setting an "M out of N" alarm. In that case, this value is the M. For more information, see `Evaluating an Alarm <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarm-evaluation>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

  

``--threshold`` (double)


  The value against which the specified statistic is compared.

  

``--comparison-operator`` (string)


  The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first operand.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold``

  
  *   ``GreaterThanThreshold``

  
  *   ``LessThanThreshold``

  
  *   ``LessThanOrEqualToThreshold``

  

  

``--treat-missing-data`` (string)


  Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. If ``TreatMissingData`` is omitted, the default behavior of ``missing`` is used. For more information, see `Configuring How CloudWatch Alarms Treats Missing Data <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarms-and-missing-data>`__ .

   

  Valid Values: ``breaching | notBreaching | ignore | missing``  

  

``--evaluate-low-sample-count-percentile`` (string)


  Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If you specify ``ignore`` , the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data points to be statistically significant. If you specify ``evaluate`` or omit this parameter, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly changes state no matter how many data points are available. For more information, see `Percentile-Based CloudWatch Alarms and Low Data Samples <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#percentiles-with-low-samples>`__ .

   

  Valid Values: ``evaluate | ignore``  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Examples
========

**To send an Amazon Simple Notification Service email message when CPU utilization exceeds 70 percent**

The following example uses the ``put-metric-alarm`` command to send an Amazon Simple Notification Service email message when CPU utilization exceeds 70 percent::

  aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name cpu-mon --alarm-description "Alarm when CPU exceeds 70 percent" --metric-name CPUUtilization --namespace AWS/EC2 --statistic Average --period 300 --threshold 70 --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold  --dimensions "Name=InstanceId,Value=i-12345678" --evaluation-periods 2 --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111122223333:MyTopic --unit Percent

This command returns to the prompt if successful. If an alarm with the same name already exists, it will be overwritten by the new alarm.

**To specify multiple dimensions**

The following example illustrates how to specify multiple dimensions. Each dimension is specified as a Name/Value pair, with a comma between the name and the value. Multiple dimensions are separated by a space::

  aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name "Default_Test_Alarm3" --alarm-description "The default example alarm" --namespace "CW EXAMPLE METRICS" --metric-name Default_Test --statistic Average --period 60 --evaluation-periods 3 --threshold 50 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --dimensions Name=key1,Value=value1 Name=key2,Value=value2
