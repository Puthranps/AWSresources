===========
Description
===========



List backups associated with an AWS account. To list backups for a given table, specify ``TableName`` . ``ListBackups`` returns a paginated list of results with at most 1MB worth of items in a page. You can also specify a limit for the maximum number of entries to be returned in a page. 

 

In the request, start time is inclusive but end time is exclusive. Note that these limits are for the time at which the original backup was requested.

 

You can call ``ListBackups`` a maximum of 5 times per second.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/dynamodb-2012-08-10/ListBackups>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``list-backups`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``BackupSummaries``

=======
Options
=======

``--table-name`` (string)


  The backups from the table specified by ``TableName`` are listed. 

  

``--time-range-lower-bound`` (timestamp)


  Only backups created after this time are listed. ``TimeRangeLowerBound`` is inclusive.

  

``--time-range-upper-bound`` (timestamp)


  Only backups created before this time are listed. ``TimeRangeUpperBound`` is exclusive. 

  

``--backup-type`` (string)


  The backups from the table specified by ``BackupType`` are listed.

   

  Where ``BackupType`` can be:

   

   
  * ``USER`` - On-demand backup created by you. 
   
  * ``SYSTEM`` - On-demand backup automatically created by DynamoDB. 
   
  * ``ALL`` - All types of on-demand backups (USER and SYSTEM). 
   

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``USER``

  
  *   ``SYSTEM``

  
  *   ``ALL``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

BackupSummaries -> (list)

  

  List of ``BackupSummary`` objects.

  

  (structure)

    

    Contains details for the backup.

    

    TableName -> (string)

      

      Name of the table.

      

      

    TableId -> (string)

      

      Unique identifier for the table.

      

      

    TableArn -> (string)

      

      ARN associated with the table.

      

      

    BackupArn -> (string)

      

      ARN associated with the backup.

      

      

    BackupName -> (string)

      

      Name of the specified backup.

      

      

    BackupCreationDateTime -> (timestamp)

      

      Time at which the backup was created.

      

      

    BackupExpiryDateTime -> (timestamp)

      

      Time at which the automatic on-demand backup created by DynamoDB will expire. This ``SYSTEM`` on-demand backup expires automatically 35 days after its creation.

      

      

    BackupStatus -> (string)

      

      Backup can be in one of the following states: CREATING, ACTIVE, DELETED.

      

      

    BackupType -> (string)

      

      BackupType:

       

       
      * ``USER`` - On-demand backup created by you. 
       
      * ``SYSTEM`` - On-demand backup automatically created by DynamoDB. 
       

      

      

    BackupSizeBytes -> (long)

      

      Size of the backup in bytes.

      

      

    

  

LastEvaluatedBackupArn -> (string)

  

  The ARN of the backup last evaluated when the current page of results was returned, inclusive of the current page of results. This value may be specified as the ``ExclusiveStartBackupArn`` of a new ``ListBackups`` operation in order to fetch the next page of results. 

   

  If ``LastEvaluatedBackupArn`` is empty, then the last page of results has been processed and there are no more results to be retrieved. 

   

  If ``LastEvaluatedBackupArn`` is not empty, this may or may not indicate there is more data to be returned. All results are guaranteed to have been returned if and only if no value for ``LastEvaluatedBackupArn`` is returned.
