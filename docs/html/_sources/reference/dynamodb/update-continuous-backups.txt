*************************

===========
Description
===========



 ``UpdateContinuousBackups`` enables or disables point in time recovery for the specified table. A successful ``UpdateContinuousBackups`` call returns the current ``ContinuousBackupsDescription`` . Continuous backups are ``ENABLED`` on all tables at table creation. If point in time recovery is enabled, ``PointInTimeRecoveryStatus`` will be set to ENABLED.

 

Once continuous backups and point in time recovery are enabled, you can restore to any point in time within ``EarliestRestorableDateTime`` and ``LatestRestorableDateTime`` . 

 

 ``LatestRestorableDateTime`` is typically 5 minutes before the current time. You can restore your table to any point in time during the last 35 days..

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
