``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

        The maximum capacity units that a global table or global secondary index should be scaled up to.

          Represents the properties of the scaling policy.

          

          PolicyName -> (string)

              Indicates whether scale in by the target tracking policy is disabled.

                  The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale out activity completes before another scale out activity can start. While the cooldown period is in effect, the capacity that has been added by the previous scale out event that initiated the cooldown is calculated as part of the desired capacity for the next scale out. You should continuously (but not excessively) scale out.
