``--backup-arn`` (string)


  The ARN associated with the backup.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

    KeySchema -> (list)

      

      Schema of the table. 

      

      (structure)

        

        Represents *a single element* of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index.

         

        A ``KeySchemaElement`` represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one ``KeySchemaElement`` (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one ``KeySchemaElement`` for the partition key, and another ``KeySchemaElement`` for the sort key.

         

        A ``KeySchemaElement`` must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map.

        

        AttributeName -> (string)

          

          The name of a key attribute.

          

          

        KeyType -> (string)

          

          The role that this key attribute will assume:

           

           
          * ``HASH`` - partition key 
           
          * ``RANGE`` - sort key 
           

           

          .. note::

             

            The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute* . The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB' usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

             

            The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute* . The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

             

          

          

        

      

    TableCreationDateTime -> (timestamp)

      

      Time when the source table was created. 

      

      

    ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)

      

      Read IOPs and Write IOPS on the table when the backup was created.

      

      ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)

        

        The maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ``ThrottlingException`` . For more information, see `Specifying Read and Write Requirements <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html#ProvisionedThroughput>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide* .

        

        

      WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)

        

        The maximum number of writes consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ``ThrottlingException`` . For more information, see `Specifying Read and Write Requirements <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html#ProvisionedThroughput>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide* .

        

        

      

    ItemCount -> (long)

      

      Number of items in the table. Please note this is an approximate value. 

      

      

    

  SourceTableFeatureDetails -> (structure)

    

    Contains the details of the features enabled on the table when the backup was created. For example, LSIs, GSIs, streams, TTL.

    

    LocalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)

      

      Represents the LSI properties for the table when the backup was created. It includes the IndexName, KeySchema and Projection for the LSIs on the table at the time of backup. 

      

      (structure)

        

        Represents the properties of a local secondary index for the table when the backup was created.

        

        IndexName -> (string)

          

          Represents the name of the local secondary index.

          

          

        KeySchema -> (list)

          

          The complete key schema for a local secondary index, which consists of one or more pairs of attribute names and key types:

           

           
          * ``HASH`` - partition key 
           
          * ``RANGE`` - sort key

            KeyType -> (string)

              * ``HASH`` - partition key 
               
              * ``RANGE`` - sort key

        Projection -> (structure)

          

          Represents attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the global secondary index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected. 

          

          ProjectionType -> (string)

            

            The set of attributes that are projected into the index:
