===========
Description
===========



Creates a backup for an existing table.

 

Each time you create an On-Demand Backup, the entire table data is backed up. There is no limit to the number of on-demand backups that can be taken. 

 

When you create an On-Demand Backup, a time marker of the request is cataloged, and the backup is created asynchronously, by applying all changes until the time of the request to the last full table snapshot. Backup requests are processed instantaneously and become available for restore within minutes. 

 

You can call ``CreateBackup`` at a maximum rate of 50 times per second.

 

All backups in DynamoDB work without consuming any provisioned throughput on the table.

 

If you submit a backup request on 2018-12-14 at 14:25:00, the backup is guaranteed to contain all data committed to the table up to 14:24:00, and data committed after 14:26:00 will not be. The backup may or may not contain data modifications made between 14:24:00 and 14:26:00. On-Demand Backup does not support causal consistency. 

 

Along with data, the following are also included on the backups: 

 

 
* Global secondary indexes (GSIs) 
 
* Local secondary indexes (LSIs) 
 
* Streams 
 
* Provisioned read and write capacity

Synopsis

    create-backup

=======
Options
=======

``--table-name`` (string)


  The name of the table.

  

``--backup-name`` (string)


  Specified name for the backup.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
