``--global-table-name`` (string)


  The name of the global table to describe.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

        The maximum capacity units that a global table or global secondary index should be scaled up to.

        

        

      AutoScalingDisabled -> (boolean)

        

        Disabled autoscaling for this global table or global secondary index.

        (structure)

          

          Represents the properties of the scaling policy.

          

          PolicyName -> (string)

            

            The name of the scaling policy.

            Represents a target tracking scaling policy configuration.

            

            DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)

              

              Indicates whether scale in by the target tracking policy is disabled. If the value is true, scale in is disabled and the target tracking policy won't remove capacity from the scalable resource. Otherwise, scale in is enabled and the target tracking policy can remove capacity from the scalable resource. The default value is false.

              

              

            ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)

              

              The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale in activity completes before another scale in activity can start. The cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale in requests until it has expired. You should scale in conservatively to protect your application's availability. However, if another alarm triggers a scale out policy during the cooldown period after a scale-in, application autoscaling scales out your scalable target immediately. 

              

              

            ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)

              

              The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale out activity completes before another scale out activity can start. While the cooldown period is in effect, the capacity that has been added by the previous scale out event that initiated the cooldown is calculated as part of the desired capacity for the next scale out. You should continuously (but not excessively) scale out.

              

              

            TargetValue -> (double)
