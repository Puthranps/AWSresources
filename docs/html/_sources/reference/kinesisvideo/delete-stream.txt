===========
Description
===========



Deletes a Kinesis video stream and the data contained in the stream. 

 

This method marks the stream for deletion, and makes the data in the stream inaccessible immediately.

 

 

 

To ensure that you have the latest version of the stream before deleting it, you can specify the stream version. Kinesis Video Streams assigns a version to each stream. When you update a stream, Kinesis Video Streams assigns a new version number. To get the latest stream version, use the ``DescribeStream`` API. 

 

This operation requires permission for the ``KinesisVideo:DeleteStream`` action.

Options

``--stream-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream that you want to delete. 

  

``--current-version`` (string)


  Optional: The version of the stream that you want to delete. 

   

  Specify the version as a safeguard to ensure that your are deleting the correct stream. To get the stream version, use the ``DescribeStream`` API.

   

  If not specified, only the ``CreationTime`` is checked before deleting the stream.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
