===========
Description
===========



Returns an array of ``StreamInfo`` objects. Each object describes a stream. To retrieve only streams that satisfy a specific condition, you can specify a ``StreamNameCondition`` . 



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/kinesisvideo-2017-09-30/ListStreams>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

    list-streams

=======
Options
=======

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of streams to return in the response. The default is 10,000.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  If you specify this parameter, when the result of a ``ListStreams`` operation is truncated, the call returns the ``NextToken`` in the response. To get another batch of streams, provide this token in your next request.

  

``--stream-name-condition`` (structure)


  Optional: Returns only streams that satisfy a specific condition. Currently, you can specify only the prefix of a stream name as a condition. 

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    ComparisonOperator=string,ComparisonValue=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "ComparisonOperator": "BEGINS_WITH",
    "ComparisonValue": "string"
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
