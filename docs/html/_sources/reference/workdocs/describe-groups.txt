=======
Options
=======

``--authentication-token`` (string)


  Amazon WorkDocs authentication token. Do not set this field when using administrative API actions, as in accessing the API using AWS credentials.

  

``--search-query`` (string)


  A query to describe groups by group name.

  

``--organization-id`` (string)


  The ID of the organization.

  

``--marker`` (string)


  The marker for the next set of results. (You received this marker from a previous call.)

  

``--limit`` (integer)


  The maximum number of items to return with this call.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
