Synopsis

    describe-activities
  [--authentication-token <value>]
  [--start-time <value>]
  [--end-time <value>]
  [--organization-id <value>]
  [--user-id <value>]
  [--limit <value>]
  [--marker <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--authentication-token`` (string)


  Amazon WorkDocs authentication token. Do not set this field when using administrative API actions, as in accessing the API using AWS credentials.

  

``--start-time`` (timestamp)


  The timestamp that determines the starting time of the activities. The response includes the activities performed after the specified timestamp.

  

``--end-time`` (timestamp)


  The timestamp that determines the end time of the activities. The response includes the activities performed before the specified timestamp.

  

``--organization-id`` (string)


  The ID of the organization. This is a mandatory parameter when using administrative API (SigV4) requests.

  

``--user-id`` (string)


  The ID of the user who performed the action. The response includes activities pertaining to this user. This is an optional parameter and is only applicable for administrative API (SigV4) requests.

  

``--limit`` (integer)


  The maximum number of items to return.

  

``--marker`` (string)


  The marker for the next set of results.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
