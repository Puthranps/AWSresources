  --load-balancer-name <value>

=======
Options
=======

``--load-balancer-name`` (string)


  The load balancer name where you want to create the SSL/TLS certificate.

  

``--certificate-name`` (string)


  The SSL/TLS certificate name.

   

  You can have up to 10 certificates in your account at one time. Each Lightsail load balancer can have up to 2 certificates associated with it at one time. There is also an overall limit to the number of certificates that can be issue in a 365-day period. For more information, see `Limits <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-limits.html>`__ .

  

``--certificate-domain-name`` (string)


  The domain name (e.g., ``example.com`` ) for your SSL/TLS certificate.

  

``--certificate-alternative-names`` (list)


  An array of strings listing alternative domains and subdomains for your SSL/TLS certificate. Lightsail will de-dupe the names for you. You can have a maximum of 9 alternative names (in addition to the 1 primary domain). We do not support wildcards (e.g., ``*.example.com`` ).

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
