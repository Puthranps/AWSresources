===========
Description
===========



Returns information about all load balancers in an account.

 

If you are describing a long list of load balancers, you can paginate the output to make the list more manageable. You can use the pageToken and nextPageToken values to retrieve the next items in the list.

Synopsis

::

    get-load-balancers
  [--page-token <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--page-token`` (string)


  A token used for paginating the results from your GetLoadBalancers request.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

        instanceHealthReason -> (string)

          

          More information about the instance health. If the ``instanceHealth`` is ``healthy`` , then an ``instanceHealthReason`` value is not provided.

           

          If ** ``instanceHealth`` ** is ``initial`` , the ** ``instanceHealthReason`` ** value can be one of the following:

           

           
          * **``Lb.RegistrationInProgress`` ** - The target instance is in the process of being registered with the load balancer.

          * **``Instance.NotRegistered`` ** - The target instance is not registered with the target group. 
           
          * **``Instance.NotInUse`` ** - The target group is not used by any load balancer, or the target instance is in an Availability Zone that is not enabled for its load balancer. 
           
          * **``Instance.IpUnusable`` ** - The target IP address is reserved for use by a Lightsail load balancer.
