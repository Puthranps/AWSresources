``--relational-database-name`` (string)


  The name to use for your new database.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must contain from 2 to 255 alphanumeric characters, or hyphens. 
   
  * The first and last character must be a letter or number. 
   

  

``--availability-zone`` (string)


  The Availability Zone in which to create your new database. Use the ``us-east-2a`` case-sensitive format.

   

  You can get a list of Availability Zones by using the ``get regions`` operation. Be sure to add the ``include relational database Availability Zones`` parameter to your request.

  

``--relational-database-blueprint-id`` (string)


  The blueprint ID for your new database. A blueprint describes the major engine version of a database.

   

  You can get a list of database blueprints IDs by using the ``get relational database blueprints`` operation.

  

``--relational-database-bundle-id`` (string)


  The bundle ID for your new database. A bundle describes the performance specifications for your database.

   

  You can get a list of database bundle IDs by using the ``get relational database bundles`` operation.

  

``--master-database-name`` (string)


  The name of the master database created when the Lightsail database resource is created.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must contain from 1 to 64 alphanumeric characters. 
   
  * Cannot be a word reserved by the specified database engine 
   

  

``--master-username`` (string)


  The master user name for your new database.

  * Master user name is required. 
   
  * Must contain from 1 to 16 alphanumeric characters. 
   
  * The first character must be a letter. 
   
  * Cannot be a reserved word for the database engine you choose. For more information about reserved words in MySQL 5.6 or 5.7, see the Keywords and Reserved Words articles for `MySQL 5.6 <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/keywords.html>`__ or `MySQL 5.7 <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/keywords.html>`__ respectively. 
   

  

``--master-user-password`` (string)


  The password for the master user of your new database. The password can include any printable ASCII character except "/", """, or "@".

   

  Constraints: Must contain 8 to 41 characters.

  

``--preferred-backup-window`` (string)


  The daily time range during which automated backups are created for your new database if automated backups are enabled.

   

  The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region. For more information about the preferred backup window time blocks for each region, see the `Working With Backups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html#USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.BackupWindow>`__ guide in the Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) documentation.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must be in the ``hh24:mi-hh24:mi`` format. Example: ``16:00-16:30``   
   
  * Specified in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

  * Must be at least 30 minutes. 
   

  

``--preferred-maintenance-window`` (string)


  The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur on your new database.

   

  The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region, occurring on a random day of the week.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must be in the ``ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi`` format. 
   
  * Valid days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun.

``--publicly-accessible`` | ``--no-publicly-accessible`` (boolean)


  Specifies the accessibility options for your new database. A value of ``true`` specifies a database that is available to resources outside of your Lightsail account. A value of ``false`` specifies a database that is available only to your Lightsail resources in the same region as your database.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
