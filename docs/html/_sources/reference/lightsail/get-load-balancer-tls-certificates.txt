get-load-balancer-tls-certificates
**********************************



===========
Description
===========



Returns information about the TLS certificates that are associated with the specified Lightsail load balancer.

 

TLS is just an updated, more secure version of Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

 

You can have a maximum of 2 certificates associated with a Lightsail load balancer. One is active and the other is inactive.

::

    get-load-balancer-tls-certificates
  --load-balancer-name <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--load-balancer-name`` (string)


  The name of the load balancer you associated with your SSL/TLS certificate.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
