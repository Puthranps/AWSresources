=======
Options
=======

``--relational-database-name`` (string)


  The name of your database for which to get log events.

  

``--log-stream-name`` (string)


  The name of the log stream.

   

  Use the ``get relational database log streams`` operation to get a list of available log streams.

  

``--start-time`` (timestamp)


  The start of the time interval from which to get log events.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Specified in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). 
   
  * Specified in the Unix time format. For example, if you wish to use a start time of October 1, 2018, at 8 PM UTC, then you input ``1538424000`` as the start time. 
   

  

``--end-time`` (timestamp)


  The end of the time interval from which to get log events.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Specified in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). 
   
  * Specified in the Unix time format. For example, if you wish to use an end time of October 1, 2018, at 8 PM UTC, then you input ``1538424000`` as the end time. 
   

  

``--start-from-head`` | ``--no-start-from-head`` (boolean)


  Parameter to specify if the log should start from head or tail. If ``true`` is specified, the log event starts from the head of the log. If ``false`` is specified, the log event starts from the tail of the log.

   

  Default: ``false``  

  

``--page-token`` (string)


  A token used for advancing to a specific page of results for your get relational database log events request.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
