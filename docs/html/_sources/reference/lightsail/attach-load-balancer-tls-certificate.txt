************************************
attach-load-balancer-tls-certificate
************************************



===========
Description
===========



Attaches a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate to your load balancer. TLS is just an updated, more secure version of Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

 

Once you create and validate your certificate, you can attach it to your load balancer. You can also use this API to rotate the certificates on your account. Use the ``AttachLoadBalancerTlsCertificate`` operation with the non-attached certificate, and it will replace the existing one and become the attached certificate.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/lightsail-2016-11-28/AttachLoadBalancerTlsCertificate>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis
========

::

    attach-load-balancer-tls-certificate
  --load-balancer-name <value>
  --certificate-name <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--load-balancer-name`` (string)


  The name of the load balancer to which you want to associate the SSL/TLS certificate.

  

``--certificate-name`` (string)


  The name of your SSL/TLS certificate.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
