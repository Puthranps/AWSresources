Creates a new database from an existing database snapshot in Amazon Lightsail.

 

You can create a new database from a snapshot in if something goes wrong with your original database, or to change it to a different plan, such as a high availability or standard plan.

=======
Options
=======

``--relational-database-name`` (string)


  The name to use for your new database.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must contain from 2 to 255 alphanumeric characters, or hyphens. 
   
  * The first and last character must be a letter or number. 
   

  

``--availability-zone`` (string)


  The Availability Zone in which to create your new database. Use the ``us-east-2a`` case-sensitive format.

   

  You can get a list of Availability Zones by using the ``get regions`` operation. Be sure to add the ``include relational database Availability Zones`` parameter to your request.

  

``--publicly-accessible`` | ``--no-publicly-accessible`` (boolean)


  Specifies the accessibility options for your new database. A value of ``true`` specifies a database that is available to resources outside of your Lightsail account. A value of ``false`` specifies a database that is available only to your Lightsail resources in the same region as your database.

  

``--relational-database-snapshot-name`` (string)


  The name of the database snapshot from which to create your new database.

  

``--relational-database-bundle-id`` (string)


  The bundle ID for your new database. A bundle describes the performance specifications for your database.

   

  You can get a list of database bundle IDs by using the ``get relational database bundles`` operation.

   

  When creating a new database from a snapshot, you cannot choose a bundle that is smaller than the bundle of the source database.

  

``--source-relational-database-name`` (string)


  The name of the source database.

  

``--restore-time`` (timestamp)


  The date and time to restore your database from.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must be before the latest restorable time for the database. 
   
  * Cannot be specified if the ``use latest restorable time`` parameter is ``true`` . 
   
  * Specified in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). 
   
  * Specified in the Unix time format. For example, if you wish to use a restore time of October 1, 2018, at 8 PM UTC, then you input ``1538424000`` as the restore time. 
   

  

``--use-latest-restorable-time`` | ``--no-use-latest-restorable-time`` (boolean)


  Specifies whether your database is restored from the latest backup time. A value of ``true`` restores from the latest backup time. 

   

  Default: ``false``  

   

  Constraints: Cannot be specified if the ``restore time`` parameter is provided.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
