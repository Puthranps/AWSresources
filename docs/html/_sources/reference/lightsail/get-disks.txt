===========
Description
===========



Returns information about all block storage disks in your AWS account and region.

 

If you are describing a long list of disks, you can paginate the output to make the list more manageable. You can use the pageToken and nextPageToken values to retrieve the next items in the list.

    get-disks

Options

``--page-token`` (string)


  A token used for advancing to the next page of results from your GetDisks request.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
