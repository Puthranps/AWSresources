Describes the scheduled actions for the specified service namespace.

 

You can filter the results using the ``ResourceId`` , ``ScalableDimension`` , and ``ScheduledActionNames`` parameters.

 

To create a scheduled action or update an existing one, see  PutScheduledAction . If you are no longer using a scheduled action, you can delete it using  DeleteScheduledAction .

  The names of the scheduled actions to describe.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--service-namespace`` (string)


  The namespace of the AWS service that provides the resource or ``custom-resource`` for a resource provided by your own application or service. For more information, see `AWS Service Namespaces <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

  

  Possible values:

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of scheduled action results. This value can be between 1 and 50. The default value is 50.

   

  If this parameter is used, the operation returns up to ``MaxResults`` results at a time, along with a ``NextToken`` value. To get the next set of results, include the ``NextToken`` value in a subsequent call. If this parameter is not used, the operation returns up to 50 results and a ``NextToken`` value, if applicable.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token for the next set of results.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
