***********************
start-stream-encryption
***********************



===========
Description
===========



Enables or updates server-side encryption using an AWS KMS key for a specified stream. 

 

Starting encryption is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to ``UPDATING`` . After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back to ``ACTIVE`` . Updating or applying encryption normally takes a few seconds to complete, but it can take minutes. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is ``UPDATING`` . Once the status of the stream is ``ACTIVE`` , encryption begins for records written to the stream. 

 

API Limits: You can successfully apply a new AWS KMS key for server-side encryption 25 times in a rolling 24-hour period.

 

Note: It can take up to 5 seconds after the stream is in an ``ACTIVE`` status before all records written to the stream are encrypted. After you enable encryption, you can verify that encryption is applied by inspecting the API response from ``PutRecord`` or ``PutRecords`` .

=======
Options
=======

``--stream-name`` (string)


  The name of the stream for which to start encrypting records.

  

``--encryption-type`` (string)


  The encryption type to use. The only valid value is ``KMS`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``NONE``

  
  *   ``KMS``

  

  

``--key-id`` (string)


  The GUID for the customer-managed AWS KMS key to use for encryption. This value can be a globally unique identifier, a fully specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to either an alias or a key, or an alias name prefixed by "alias/".You can also use a master key owned by Kinesis Data Streams by specifying the alias ``aws/kinesis`` .

   

   
  * Key ARN example: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012``   
   
  * Alias ARN example: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName``   
   
  * Globally unique key ID example: ``12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012``   
   
  * Alias name example: ``alias/MyAliasName``   
   
  * Master key owned by Kinesis Data Streams: ``alias/aws/kinesis``   
   

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
