************************
register-stream-consumer
************************



===========
Description
===========



Registers a consumer with a Kinesis data stream. When you use this operation, the consumer you register can read data from the stream at a rate of up to 2 MiB per second. This rate is unaffected by the total number of consumers that read from the same stream.

 

You can register up to 5 consumers per stream. A given consumer can only be registered with one stream.

 

This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per account.

Options
=======

``--stream-arn`` (string)


  The ARN of the Kinesis data stream that you want to register the consumer with. For more info, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-kinesis-streams>`__ .

  

``--consumer-name`` (string)


  For a given Kinesis data stream, each consumer must have a unique name. However, consumer names don't have to be unique across data streams.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

Consumer -> (structure)

  

  An object that represents the details of the consumer you registered. When you register a consumer, it gets an ARN that is generated by Kinesis Data Streams.

  

  ConsumerName -> (string)

    

    The name of the consumer is something you choose when you register the consumer.

    

    

  ConsumerARN -> (string)

    

    When you register a consumer, Kinesis Data Streams generates an ARN for it. You need this ARN to be able to call  SubscribeToShard .

     

    If you delete a consumer and then create a new one with the same name, it won't have the same ARN. That's because consumer ARNs contain the creation timestamp. This is important to keep in mind if you have IAM policies that reference consumer ARNs.

    

    

  ConsumerStatus -> (string)

    

    A consumer can't read data while in the ``CREATING`` or ``DELETING`` states.

    

    

  ConsumerCreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
