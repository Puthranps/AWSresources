===========
Description
===========



Deletes a Kinesis data stream and all its shards and data. You must shut down any applications that are operating on the stream before you delete the stream. If an application attempts to operate on a deleted stream, it receives the exception ``ResourceNotFoundException`` .

 

If the stream is in the ``ACTIVE`` state, you can delete it. After a ``DeleteStream`` request, the specified stream is in the ``DELETING`` state until Kinesis Data Streams completes the deletion.

 

 **Note:** Kinesis Data Streams might continue to accept data read and write operations, such as  PutRecord ,  PutRecords , and  GetRecords , on a stream in the ``DELETING`` state until the stream deletion is complete.

 

When you delete a stream, any shards in that stream are also deleted, and any tags are dissociated from the stream.

 

You can use the  DescribeStream operation to check the state of the stream, which is returned in ``StreamStatus`` .

 

  DeleteStream has a limit of five transactions per second per account.

Synopsis

::

    delete-stream
  --stream-name <value>
  [--enforce-consumer-deletion | --no-enforce-consumer-deletion]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--stream-name`` (string)


  The name of the stream to delete.

  

``--enforce-consumer-deletion`` | ``--no-enforce-consumer-deletion`` (boolean)


  If this parameter is unset (``null`` ) or if you set it to ``false`` , and the stream has registered consumers, the call to ``DeleteStream`` fails with a ``ResourceInUseException`` . 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
