===========
Description
===========



To get the description of a registered consumer, provide the ARN of the consumer. Alternatively, you can provide the ARN of the data stream and the name you gave the consumer when you registered it. You may also provide all three parameters, as long as they don't conflict with each other. If you don't know the name or ARN of the consumer that you want to describe, you can use the  ListStreamConsumers operation to get a list of the descriptions of all the consumers that are currently registered with a given data stream.

 

This operation has a limit of 20 transactions per second per account.

Options
=======

``--stream-arn`` (string)


  The ARN of the Kinesis data stream that the consumer is registered with. For more information, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-kinesis-streams>`__ .

  

``--consumer-name`` (string)


  The name that you gave to the consumer.

  

``--consumer-arn`` (string)


  The ARN returned by Kinesis Data Streams when you registered the consumer.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

ConsumerDescription -> (structure)

  

  An object that represents the details of the consumer.

  

  ConsumerName -> (string)

    

    The name of the consumer is something you choose when you register the consumer.

    

    

  ConsumerARN -> (string)

    

    When you register a consumer, Kinesis Data Streams generates an ARN for it. You need this ARN to be able to call  SubscribeToShard .

     

    If you delete a consumer and then create a new one with the same name, it won't have the same ARN. That's because consumer ARNs contain the creation timestamp. This is important to keep in mind if you have IAM policies that reference consumer ARNs.

    

    

  ConsumerStatus -> (string)

    

    A consumer can't read data while in the ``CREATING`` or ``DELETING`` states.

    

    

  ConsumerCreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)

    

    

    

    

  StreamARN -> (string)

    

    The ARN of the stream with which you registered the consumer.
