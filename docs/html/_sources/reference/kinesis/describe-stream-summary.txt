Description
===========



Provides a summarized description of the specified Kinesis data stream without the shard list.

 

The information returned includes the stream name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), status, record retention period, approximate creation time, monitoring, encryption details, and open shard count.

``--stream-name`` (string)


  The name of the stream to describe.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output
======

StreamDescriptionSummary -> (structure)

  

  A  StreamDescriptionSummary containing information about the stream.

  

  StreamName -> (string)

    

    The name of the stream being described.

    

    

  StreamARN -> (string)

    

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the stream being described.

    

    

  StreamStatus -> (string)

    

    The current status of the stream being described. The stream status is one of the following states:

     

     
    * ``CREATING`` - The stream is being created. Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns and sets ``StreamStatus`` to ``CREATING`` . 
     
    * ``DELETING`` - The stream is being deleted. The specified stream is in the ``DELETING`` state until Kinesis Data Streams completes the deletion. 
     
    * ``ACTIVE`` - The stream exists and is ready for read and write operations or deletion. You should perform read and write operations only on an ``ACTIVE`` stream. 
     
    * ``UPDATING`` - Shards in the stream are being merged or split. Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the ``UPDATING`` state. 
     

    

    

  RetentionPeriodHours -> (integer)

    

    The current retention period, in hours.

    

    

  StreamCreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)

    

    The approximate time that the stream was created.

    

    

  EnhancedMonitoring -> (list)

    

    Represents the current enhanced monitoring settings of the stream.

    

    (structure)

      

      Represents enhanced metrics types.

      

      ShardLevelMetrics -> (list)

        

        List of shard-level metrics.

         

        The following are the valid shard-level metrics. The value "``ALL`` " enhances every metric.

         

         
        * ``IncomingBytes``   
         
        * ``IncomingRecords``   
         
        * ``OutgoingBytes``   
         
        * ``OutgoingRecords``   
         
        * ``WriteProvisionedThroughputExceeded``   
         
        * ``ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded``   
         
        * ``IteratorAgeMilliseconds``   
         
        * ``ALL``   
         

         

        For more information, see `Monitoring the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Service with Amazon CloudWatch <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring-with-cloudwatch.html>`__ in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide* .

        

        (string)

          

          

        

      

    

  EncryptionType -> (string)

    

    The encryption type used. This value is one of the following:

     

     
    * ``KMS``   
     
    * ``NONE``   
     

    

    

  KeyId -> (string)

    

    The GUID for the customer-managed AWS KMS key to use for encryption. This value can be a globally unique identifier, a fully specified ARN to either an alias or a key, or an alias name prefixed by "alias/".You can also use a master key owned by Kinesis Data Streams by specifying the alias ``aws/kinesis`` .

     

     
    * Key ARN example: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012``

    * Globally unique key ID example: ``12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012``   
     
    * Alias name example: ``alias/MyAliasName``   
     
    * Master key owned by Kinesis Data Streams: ``alias/aws/kinesis``   
     

    

    

  OpenShardCount -> (integer)

    

    The number of open shards in the stream.

    

    

  ConsumerCount -> (integer)

    

    The number of enhanced fan-out consumers registered with the stream.
