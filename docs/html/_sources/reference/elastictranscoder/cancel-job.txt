===========
Description
===========



The CancelJob operation cancels an unfinished job.

 

.. note::

   

  You can only cancel a job that has a status of ``Submitted`` . To prevent a pipeline from starting to process a job while you're getting the job identifier, use  UpdatePipelineStatus to temporarily pause the pipeline.

``--id`` (string)


  The identifier of the job that you want to cancel.

   

  To get a list of the jobs (including their ``jobId`` ) that have a status of ``Submitted`` , use the  ListJobsByStatus API action.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
