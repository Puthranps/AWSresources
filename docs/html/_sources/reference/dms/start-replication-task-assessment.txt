Description

Starts the replication task assessment for unsupported data types in the source database.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis

::

    start-replication-task-assessment
  --replication-task-arn <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--replication-task-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication task. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

ReplicationTask -> (structure)

  

  The assessed replication task. 

  

  ReplicationTaskIdentifier -> (string)

    

    The user-assigned replication task identifier or name.

     

    Constraints:

     

     
    * Must contain from 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens. 
     
    * First character must be a letter. 
     
    * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. 
     

    

    

  SourceEndpointArn -> (string)

    

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) string that uniquely identifies the endpoint.

    

    

  TargetEndpointArn -> (string)

    

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) string that uniquely identifies the endpoint.

    

    

  ReplicationInstanceArn -> (string)

    

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication instance.

    

    

  MigrationType -> (string)

    

    The type of migration.

    

    

  TableMappings -> (string)

    

    Table mappings specified in the task.

    

    

  ReplicationTaskSettings -> (string)

    

    The settings for the replication task.

    

    

  Status -> (string)

    

    The status of the replication task.

    

    

  LastFailureMessage -> (string)

    

    The last error (failure) message generated for the replication instance.

    

    

  StopReason -> (string)

    

    The reason the replication task was stopped.

    

    

  ReplicationTaskCreationDate -> (timestamp)

    

    The date the replication task was created.

    

    

  ReplicationTaskStartDate -> (timestamp)

    

    The date the replication task is scheduled to start.

    

    

  CdcStartPosition -> (string)

    

    Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to start. Use either CdcStartPosition or CdcStartTime to specify when you want a CDC operation to start. Specifying both values results in an error.

     

    The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format.

     

    Date Example: --cdc-start-position “2018-03-08T12:12:12”

     

    Checkpoint Example: --cdc-start-position "checkpoint:V1#27#mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1975:-1:2002:677883278264080:mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1876#0#0#*#0#93"

     

    LSN Example: --cdc-start-position “mysql-bin-changelog.000024:373”

    

    

  CdcStopPosition -> (string)

    

    Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to stop. The value can be either server time or commit time.

     

    Server time example: --cdc-stop-position “server_time:3018-02-09T12:12:12”

     

    Commit time example: --cdc-stop-position “commit_time: 3018-02-09T12:12:12 “

    

    

  RecoveryCheckpoint -> (string)

    

    Indicates the last checkpoint that occurred during a change data capture (CDC) operation. You can provide this value to the ``CdcStartPosition`` parameter to start a CDC operation that begins at that checkpoint.

    

    

  ReplicationTaskArn -> (string)

    

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication task.

    

    

  ReplicationTaskStats -> (structure)

    

    The statistics for the task, including elapsed time, tables loaded, and table errors.

    

    FullLoadProgressPercent -> (integer)

      

      The percent complete for the full load migration task.

      

      

    ElapsedTimeMillis -> (long)

      

      The elapsed time of the task, in milliseconds.

      The number of tables loaded for this task.

      

      

    TablesLoading -> (integer)

      

      The number of tables currently loading for this task.
