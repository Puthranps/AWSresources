Options
=======

``--status`` (string)


  When specified, returns only transcription jobs with the specified status.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``IN_PROGRESS``

  
  *   ``FAILED``

  
  *   ``COMPLETED``

  

  

``--job-name-contains`` (string)


  When specified, the jobs returned in the list are limited to jobs whose name contains the specified string.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  If the result of the previous request to ``ListTranscriptionJobs`` was truncated, include the ``NextToken`` to fetch the next set of jobs.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of jobs to return in the response. If there are fewer results in the list, this response contains only the actual results.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Output
======

Status -> (string)

  

  The requested status of the jobs returned.

  

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  The ``ListTranscriptionJobs`` operation returns a page of jobs at a time. The maximum size of the page is set by the ``MaxResults`` parameter. If there are more jobs in the list than the page size, Amazon Transcribe returns the ``NextPage`` token. Include the token in the next request to the ``ListTranscriptionJobs`` operation to return in the next page of jobs.

  

  

TranscriptionJobSummaries -> (list)

  

  A list of objects containing summary information for a transcription job.

  

  (structure)

    

    Provides a summary of information about a transcription job. Note that en-AU, en-UK, and fr-CA languages are in preview and are only available to whitelisted customers.

    

    TranscriptionJobName -> (string)

      

      The name of the transcription job.

      

      

    CreationTime -> (timestamp)

      

      A timestamp that shows when the job was created.

      

      

    CompletionTime -> (timestamp)

      

      A timestamp that shows when the job was completed.

      

      

    LanguageCode -> (string)

      

      The language code for the input speech.

      

      

    TranscriptionJobStatus -> (string)

      

      The status of the transcription job. When the status is ``COMPLETED`` , use the ``GetTranscriptionJob`` operation to get the results of the transcription.

      

      

    FailureReason -> (string)

      

      If the ``TranscriptionJobStatus`` field is ``FAILED`` , a description of the error.

      

      

    OutputLocationType -> (string)

      

      Indicates the location of the output of the transcription job.

       

      If the value is ``CUSTOMER_BUCKET`` then the location is the S3 bucket specified in the ``outputBucketName`` field when the transcription job was started with the ``StartTranscriptionJob`` operation.

       

      If the value is ``SERVICE_BUCKET`` then the output is stored by Amazon Transcribe and can be retrieved using the URI in the ``GetTranscriptionJob`` response's ``TranscriptFileUri`` field.
