  [--next-token <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--next-token`` (string)


  If the result of the previous request to ``ListVocabularies`` was truncated, include the ``NextToken`` to fetch the next set of jobs.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of vocabularies to return in the response. If there are fewer results in the list, this response contains only the actual results.

  

``--state-equals`` (string)


  When specified, only returns vocabularies with the ``VocabularyState`` field equal to the specified state.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``PENDING``

  
  *   ``READY``

  
  *   ``FAILED``

  

  

``--name-contains`` (string)


  When specified, the vocabularies returned in the list are limited to vocabularies whose name contains the specified string. The search is case-insensitive, ``ListVocabularies`` will return both "vocabularyname" and "VocabularyName" in the response list.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

Status -> (string)

  

  The requested vocabulary state.

  

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  The ``ListVocabularies`` operation returns a page of vocabularies at a time. The maximum size of the page is set by the ``MaxResults`` parameter. If there are more jobs in the list than the page size, Amazon Transcribe returns the ``NextPage`` token. Include the token in the next request to the ``ListVocabularies`` operation to return in the next page of jobs.

  

  

Vocabularies -> (list)

  

  A list of objects that describe the vocabularies that match the search criteria in the request.

  

  (structure)

    

    Provides information about a custom vocabulary. Note that vocabularies for en-AU, en-UK, and fr-CA languages that are in preview are not available. In the console, the vocabulary section will be greyed-out and SDK will return error message.

    

    VocabularyName -> (string)

      

      The name of the vocabulary.

      

      

    LanguageCode -> (string)

      

      The language code of the vocabulary entries.

      

      

    LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time that the vocabulary was last modified.

      

      

    VocabularyState -> (string)

      

      The processing state of the vocabulary. If the state is ``READY`` you can use the vocabulary in a ``StartTranscriptionJob`` request.
