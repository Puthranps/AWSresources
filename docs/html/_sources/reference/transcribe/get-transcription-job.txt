    get-transcription-job
  --transcription-job-name <value>

Options

``--transcription-job-name`` (string)


  The name of the job.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

TranscriptionJob -> (structure)

  

  An object that contains the results of the transcription job.

  

  TranscriptionJobName -> (string)

    

    The name of the transcription job.

    

    

  TranscriptionJobStatus -> (string)

    

    The status of the transcription job.

    

    

  LanguageCode -> (string)

    

    The language code for the input speech.

    

    

  MediaSampleRateHertz -> (integer)

    

    The sample rate, in Hertz, of the audio track in the input media file. 

    

    

  MediaFormat -> (string)

    

    The format of the input media file.

    

    

  Media -> (structure)

    

    An object that describes the input media for the transcription job.

    

    MediaFileUri -> (string)

      

      The S3 location of the input media file. The URI must be in the same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The general form is:

       

       ``https://<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name>/<keyprefix>/<objectkey>``  

       

      For example:

       

       ``https://s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/examplebucket/example.mp4``  

       

       ``https://s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/examplebucket/mediadocs/example.mp4``  

       

      For more information about S3 object names, see `Object Keys <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html#object-keys>`__ in the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide* .

      

      

    

  Transcript -> (structure)

    

    An object that describes the output of the transcription job.

    

    TranscriptFileUri -> (string)

      

      The location where the transcription is stored.

       

      Use this URI to access the transcription. If you specified an S3 bucket in the ``OutputBucketName`` field when you created the job, this is the URI of that bucket. If you chose to store the transcription in Amazon Transcribe, this is a shareable URL that provides secure access to that location.

      

      

    

  CreationTime -> (timestamp)

    

    A timestamp that shows when the job was created.

    

    

  CompletionTime -> (timestamp)

    

    A timestamp that shows when the job was completed.

    

    

  FailureReason -> (string)

    

    If the ``TranscriptionJobStatus`` field is ``FAILED`` , this field contains information about why the job failed.

    

    

  Settings -> (structure)

    

    Optional settings for the transcription job. Use these settings to turn on speaker recognition, to set the maximum number of speakers that should be identified and to specify a custom vocabulary to use when processing the transcription job.

    

    VocabularyName -> (string)

      

      The name of a vocabulary to use when processing the transcription job.

      

      

    ShowSpeakerLabels -> (boolean)

      

      Determines whether the transcription job uses speaker recognition to identify different speakers in the input audio. Speaker recognition labels individual speakers in the audio file. If you set the ``ShowSpeakerLabels`` field to true, you must also set the maximum number of speaker labels ``MaxSpeakerLabels`` field.

       

      You can't set both ``ShowSpeakerLabels`` and ``ChannelIdentification`` in the same request. If you set both, your request returns a ``BadRequestException`` .

      

      

    MaxSpeakerLabels -> (integer)

      

      The maximum number of speakers to identify in the input audio. If there are more speakers in the audio than this number, multiple speakers will be identified as a single speaker. If you specify the ``MaxSpeakerLabels`` field, you must set the ``ShowSpeakerLabels`` field to true.

      

      

    ChannelIdentification -> (boolean)

      

      Instructs Amazon Transcribe to process each audio channel separately and then merge the transcription output of each channel into a single transcription. 

       

      Amazon Transcribe also produces a transcription of each item detected on an audio channel, including the start time and end time of the item and alternative transcriptions of the item including the confidence that Amazon Transcribe has in the transcription.

       

      You can't set both ``ShowSpeakerLabels`` and ``ChannelIdentification`` in the same request. If you set both, your request returns a ``BadRequestException`` .
