::

    list-brokers
  [--max-results <value>]
  [--next-token <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--max-results`` (integer)
The maximum number of brokers that Amazon MQ can return per page (20 by default). This value must be an integer from 5 to 100.

``--next-token`` (string)
The token that specifies the next page of results Amazon MQ should return. To request the first page, leave nextToken empty.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
