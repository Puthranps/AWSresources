::

    describe-channel
  --channel-name <value>
  [--include-statistics | --no-include-statistics]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--channel-name`` (string)


  The name of the channel whose information is retrieved.

  

``--include-statistics`` | ``--no-include-statistics`` (boolean)


  If true, additional statistical information about the channel is included in the response.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
