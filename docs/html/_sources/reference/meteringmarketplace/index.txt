Description
===========

 

This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace Metering Service API.

 

AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom usage dimensions.

 

 **Submitting Metering Records**  

 

 
* *MeterUsage* - Submits the metering record for a Marketplace product. MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance. 
 
* *BatchMeterUsage* - Submits the metering record for a set of customers. BatchMeterUsage is called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application. 
 

 

 **Accepting New Customers**  

 

 
* *ResolveCustomer* - Called by a SaaS application during the registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the registration process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through the browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this API to obtain a CustomerIdentifier and Product Code.
