***************************
start-speech-synthesis-task
***************************



===========
Description
===========



Allows the creation of an asynchronous synthesis task, by starting a new ``SpeechSynthesisTask`` . This operation requires all the standard information needed for speech synthesis, plus the name of an Amazon S3 bucket for the service to store the output of the synthesis task and two optional parameters (OutputS3KeyPrefix and SnsTopicArn). Once the synthesis task is created, this operation will return a SpeechSynthesisTask object, which will include an identifier of this task as well as the current status.

Options
=======

``--lexicon-names`` (list)


  List of one or more pronunciation lexicon names you want the service to apply during synthesis. Lexicons are applied only if the language of the lexicon is the same as the language of the voice. 

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...

``--language-code`` (string)


  Optional language code for the Speech Synthesis request. This is only necessary if using a bilingual voice, such as Aditi, which can be used for either Indian English (en-IN) or Hindi (hi-IN). 

   

  If a bilingual voice is used and no language code is specified, Amazon Polly will use the default language of the bilingual voice. The default language for any voice is the one returned by the `DescribeVoices <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_DescribeVoices.html>`__ operation for the ``LanguageCode`` parameter. For example, if no language code is specified, Aditi will use Indian English rather than Hindi.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
