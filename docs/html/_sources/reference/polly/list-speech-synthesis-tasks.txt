===========
Description
===========



Returns a list of SpeechSynthesisTask objects ordered by their creation date. This operation can filter the tasks by their status, for example, allowing users to list only tasks that are completed.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis

    list-speech-synthesis-tasks

  [--status <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Maximum number of speech synthesis tasks returned in a List operation.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The pagination token to use in the next request to continue the listing of speech synthesis tasks. 

  

``--status`` (string)


  Status of the speech synthesis tasks returned in a List operation

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``scheduled``

  
  *   ``inProgress``

  
  *   ``completed``

  
  *   ``failed``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

NextToken -> (string)

  

  An opaque pagination token returned from the previous List operation in this request. If present, this indicates where to continue the listing.

  

  

SynthesisTasks -> (list)

  

  List of SynthesisTask objects that provides information from the specified task in the list request, including output format, creation time, task status, and so on.

  

  (structure)

    

    SynthesisTask object that provides information about a speech synthesis task.

    

    TaskId -> (string)

      

      The Amazon Polly generated identifier for a speech synthesis task.

      

      

    TaskStatus -> (string)

      

      Current status of the individual speech synthesis task.

      

      

    TaskStatusReason -> (string)

      

      Reason for the current status of a specific speech synthesis task, including errors if the task has failed.

      

      

    OutputUri -> (string)

      

      Pathway for the output speech file.

      

      

    CreationTime -> (timestamp)

      

      Timestamp for the time the synthesis task was started.

      

      

    RequestCharacters -> (integer)

      

      Number of billable characters synthesized.

      

      

    SnsTopicArn -> (string)

      

      ARN for the SNS topic optionally used for providing status notification for a speech synthesis task.

      

      

    LexiconNames -> (list)

      

      List of one or more pronunciation lexicon names you want the service to apply during synthesis. Lexicons are applied only if the language of the lexicon is the same as the language of the voice. 

      

      (string)

        

        

      

    OutputFormat -> (string)

      

      The format in which the returned output will be encoded. For audio stream, this will be mp3, ogg_vorbis, or pcm. For speech marks, this will be json. 

      

      

    SampleRate -> (string)

      

      The audio frequency specified in Hz.

       

      The valid values for mp3 and ogg_vorbis are "8000", "16000", and "22050". The default value is "22050".

       

      Valid values for pcm are "8000" and "16000" The default value is "16000". 

      

      

    SpeechMarkTypes -> (list)

      

      The type of speech marks returned for the input text.

      

      (string)

        

        

      

    TextType -> (string)

      

      Specifies whether the input text is plain text or SSML. The default value is plain text. 

      

      

    VoiceId -> (string)

      

      Voice ID to use for the synthesis. 

      

      

    LanguageCode -> (string)

      

      Optional language code for a synthesis task. This is only necessary if using a bilingual voice, such as Aditi, which can be used for either Indian English (en-IN) or Hindi (hi-IN). 

       

      If a bilingual voice is used and no language code is specified, Amazon Polly will use the default language of the bilingual voice. The default language for any voice is the one returned by the `DescribeVoices <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_DescribeVoices.html>`__ operation for the ``LanguageCode`` parameter. For example, if no language code is specified, Aditi will use Indian English rather than Hindi.
