===========
Description
===========



Returns the list of voices that are available for use when requesting speech synthesis. Each voice speaks a specified language, is either male or female, and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII version of the voice name. 

 

When synthesizing speech ( ``SynthesizeSpeech`` ), you provide the voice ID for the voice you want from the list of voices returned by ``DescribeVoices`` .

 

For example, you want your news reader application to read news in a specific language, but giving a user the option to choose the voice. Using the ``DescribeVoices`` operation you can provide the user with a list of available voices to select from.

 

You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available voices. For example, if you specify ``en-US`` , the operation returns a list of all available US English voices. 

 

This operation requires permissions to perform the ``polly:DescribeVoices`` action.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``describe-voices`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Voices``

``--language-code`` (string)


  The language identification tag (ISO 639 code for the language name-ISO 3166 country code) for filtering the list of voices returned. If you don't specify this optional parameter, all available voices are returned. 

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``cmn-CN``

  
  *   ``cy-GB``

  
  *   ``da-DK``

  
  *   ``de-DE``

  
  *   ``en-AU``

  
  *   ``en-GB``

  
  *   ``en-GB-WLS``

  
  *   ``en-IN``

  
  *   ``en-US``

  
  *   ``es-ES``

  
  *   ``es-US``

  
  *   ``fr-CA``

  
  *   ``fr-FR``

  
  *   ``is-IS``

  
  *   ``it-IT``

  
  *   ``ja-JP``

  
  *   ``hi-IN``

  
  *   ``ko-KR``

  
  *   ``nb-NO``

  
  *   ``nl-NL``

  
  *   ``pl-PL``

  
  *   ``pt-BR``

  *   ``ro-RO``

  
  *   ``ru-RU``

  
  *   ``sv-SE``

  
  *   ``tr-TR``

  

  

``--include-additional-language-codes`` | ``--no-include-additional-language-codes`` (boolean)


  Boolean value indicating whether to return any bilingual voices that use the specified language as an additional language. For instance, if you request all languages that use US English (es-US), and there is an Italian voice that speaks both Italian (it-IT) and US English, that voice will be included if you specify ``yes`` but not if you specify ``no`` .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

Voices -> (list)

  

  A list of voices with their properties.

  

  (structure)

    

    Description of the voice.

    

    Gender -> (string)

      

      Gender of the voice.

      

      

    Id -> (string)

      

      Amazon Polly assigned voice ID. This is the ID that you specify when calling the ``SynthesizeSpeech`` operation.

      

      

    LanguageCode -> (string)

      

      Language code of the voice.

      

      

    LanguageName -> (string)

      

      Human readable name of the language in English.

      

      

    Name -> (string)

      

      Name of the voice (for example, Salli, Kendra, etc.). This provides a human readable voice name that you might display in your application.

      

      

    AdditionalLanguageCodes -> (list)

      

      Additional codes for languages available for the specified voice in addition to its default language. 

       

      For example, the default language for Aditi is Indian English (en-IN) because it was first used for that language. Since Aditi is bilingual and fluent in both Indian English and Hindi, this parameter would show the code ``hi-IN`` .

      

      (string)

        

        

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  The pagination token to use in the next request to continue the listing of voices. ``NextToken`` is returned only if the response is truncated.
