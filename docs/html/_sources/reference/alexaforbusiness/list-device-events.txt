=======
Options
=======

``--device-arn`` (string)


  The ARN of a device.

  

``--event-type`` (string)


  The event type to filter device events. If EventType isn't specified, this returns a list of all device events in reverse chronological order. If EventType is specified, this returns a list of device events for that EventType in reverse chronological order. 

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``CONNECTION_STATUS``

  
  *   ``DEVICE_STATUS``

  

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  An optional token returned from a prior request. Use this token for pagination of results from this action. If this parameter is specified, the response only includes results beyond the token, up to the value specified by MaxResults. When the end of results is reached, the response has a value of null.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to include in the response. The default value is 50. If more results exist than the specified MaxResults value, a token is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
