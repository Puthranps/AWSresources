=======
Options
=======

``--filters`` (list)


  The filters to use to list a specified set of address books. The supported filter key is AddressBookName.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Key=string,Values=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--sort-criteria`` (list)


  The sort order to use in listing the specified set of address books. The supported sort key is AddressBookName.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Key=string,Value=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",
      "Value": "ASC"|"DESC"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--next-token`` (string)


  An optional token returned from a prior request. Use this token for pagination of results from this action. If this parameter is specified, the response only includes results beyond the token, up to the value specified by MaxResults.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to include in the response. If more results exist than the specified MaxResults value, a token is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
