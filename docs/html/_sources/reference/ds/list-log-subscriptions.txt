Options
=======

``--directory-id`` (string)


  If a *DirectoryID* is provided, lists only the log subscription associated with that directory. If no *DirectoryId* is provided, lists all log subscriptions associated with your AWS account. If there are no log subscriptions for the AWS account or the directory, an empty list will be returned.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token for the next set of items to return.

  

``--limit`` (integer)


  The maximum number of items returned.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
