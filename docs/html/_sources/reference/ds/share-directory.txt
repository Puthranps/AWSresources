share-directory

===========
Description
===========



Shares a specified directory (``DirectoryId`` ) in your AWS account (directory owner) with another AWS account (directory consumer). With this operation you can use your directory from any AWS account and from any Amazon VPC within an AWS Region.

 

When you share your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory, AWS Directory Service creates a shared directory in the directory consumer account. This shared directory contains the metadata to provide access to the directory within the directory owner account. The shared directory is visible in all VPCs in the directory consumer account.

 

The ``ShareMethod`` parameter determines whether the specified directory can be shared between AWS accounts inside the same AWS organization (``ORGANIZATIONS`` ). It also determines whether you can share the directory with any other AWS account either inside or outside of the organization (``HANDSHAKE`` ).

 

The ``ShareNotes`` parameter is only used when ``HANDSHAKE`` is called, which sends a directory sharing request to the directory consumer.

Options

``--directory-id`` (string)


  Identifier of the AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory that you want to share with other AWS accounts.

  

``--share-notes`` (string)


  A directory share request that is sent by the directory owner to the directory consumer. The request includes a typed message to help the directory consumer administrator determine whether to approve or reject the share invitation.

  

``--share-target`` (structure)


  Identifier for the directory consumer account with whom the directory is to be shared.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Id=string,Type=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "Id": "string",
    "Type": "ACCOUNT"
  }



``--share-method`` (string)


  The method used when sharing a directory to determine whether the directory should be shared within your AWS organization (``ORGANIZATIONS`` ) or with any AWS account by sending a directory sharing request (``HANDSHAKE`` ).

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``ORGANIZATIONS``

  
  *   ``HANDSHAKE``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
