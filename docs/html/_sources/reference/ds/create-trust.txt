===========
Description
===========



AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory allows you to configure trust relationships. For example, you can establish a trust between your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory, and your existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. This would allow you to provide users and groups access to resources in either domain, with a single set of credentials.

 

This action initiates the creation of the AWS side of a trust relationship between an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory and an external domain. You can create either a forest trust or an external trust.
