=======
Options
=======

``--domain-name`` (string)


  [Required] The name of the  DomainName resource.

  

``--certificate-name`` (string)


  The user-friendly name of the certificate that will be used by edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name.

  

``--certificate-body`` (string)


  [Deprecated] The body of the server certificate that will be used by edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name provided by your certificate authority.

  

``--certificate-private-key`` (string)


  [Deprecated] Your edge-optimized endpoint's domain name certificate's private key.

  

``--certificate-chain`` (string)


  [Deprecated] The intermediate certificates and optionally the root certificate, one after the other without any blank lines, used by an edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name. If you include the root certificate, your certificate chain must start with intermediate certificates and end with the root certificate. Use the intermediate certificates that were provided by your certificate authority. Do not include any intermediaries that are not in the chain of trust path.

  

``--certificate-arn`` (string)


  The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that will be used by edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name. AWS Certificate Manager is the only supported source.

  

``--regional-certificate-name`` (string)


  The user-friendly name of the certificate that will be used by regional endpoint for this domain name.

  

``--regional-certificate-arn`` (string)


  The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that will be used by regional endpoint for this domain name. AWS Certificate Manager is the only supported source.

  

``--endpoint-configuration`` (structure)


  The endpoint configuration of this  DomainName showing the endpoint types of the domain name. 

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    types=string,string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "types": ["REGIONAL"|"EDGE"|"PRIVATE", ...]
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples
========

**To create the custom domain name**

Command::

  aws apigateway create-domain-name --domain-name 'my.domain.tld' --certificate-name 'my.domain.tld cert' --certificate-arn 'arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:012345678910:certificate/fb1b9770-a305-495d-aefb-27e5e101ff3' 


======
Output
======

domainName -> (string)

  

  The custom domain name as an API host name, for example, ``my-api.example.com`` .

  

  

certificateName -> (string)

  

  The name of the certificate that will be used by edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name.

  

  

certificateArn -> (string)

  

  The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that will be used by edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name. AWS Certificate Manager is the only supported source.

  

  

certificateUploadDate -> (timestamp)

  

  The timestamp when the certificate that was used by edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name was uploaded.

  

  

regionalDomainName -> (string)

  

  The domain name associated with the regional endpoint for this custom domain name. You set up this association by adding a DNS record that points the custom domain name to this regional domain name. The regional domain name is returned by API Gateway when you create a regional endpoint.

  

  

regionalHostedZoneId -> (string)

  

  The region-specific Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone ID of the regional endpoint. For more information, see `Set up a Regional Custom Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-regional-api-custom-domain-create.html>`__ and `AWS Regions and Endpoints for API Gateway <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#apigateway_region>`__ . 

  

  

regionalCertificateName -> (string)

  

  The name of the certificate that will be used for validating the regional domain name.

  

  

regionalCertificateArn -> (string)

  

  The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that will be used for validating the regional domain name. AWS Certificate Manager is the only supported source.

  

  

distributionDomainName -> (string)

  

  The domain name of the Amazon CloudFront distribution associated with this custom domain name for an edge-optimized endpoint. You set up this association when adding a DNS record pointing the custom domain name to this distribution name. For more information about CloudFront distributions, see the `Amazon CloudFront documentation <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cloudfront/>`__ .

  

  

distributionHostedZoneId -> (string)

  

  The region-agnostic Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone ID of the edge-optimized endpoint. The valid value is ``Z2FDTNDATAQYW2`` for all the regions. For more information, see `Set up a Regional Custom Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-regional-api-custom-domain-create.html>`__ and `AWS Regions and Endpoints for API Gateway <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#apigateway_region>`__ . 

  

  

endpointConfiguration -> (structure)

  

  The endpoint configuration of this  DomainName showing the endpoint types of the domain name. 

  

  types -> (list)

    

    A list of endpoint types of an API ( RestApi ) or its custom domain name ( DomainName ). For an edge-optimized API and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is ``"EDGE"`` . For a regional API and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is ``REGIONAL`` . For a private API, the endpoint type is ``PRIVATE`` .

    

    (string)

      

      The endpoint type. The valid values are ``EDGE`` for edge-optimized API setup, most suitable for mobile applications; ``REGIONAL`` for regional API endpoint setup, most suitable for calling from AWS Region; and ``PRIVATE`` for private APIs.
