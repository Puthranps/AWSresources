Description

Represents a collection of  DomainName resources.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``get-domain-names`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``items``

Synopsis

::

    get-domain-names
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--starting-token <value>]
  [--page-size <value>]
  [--max-items <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

**To get a list of custom domain names**

Command::

      ]
  }

position -> (string)

  

  

items -> (list)

  

  The current page of elements from this collection.

  

  (structure)

    

    Represents a custom domain name as a user-friendly host name of an API ( RestApi ).

      

    When you deploy an API, API Gateway creates a default host name for the API. This default API host name is of the ``{restapi-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com`` format. With the default host name, you can access the API's root resource with the URL of ``https://{restapi-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage}/`` . When you set up a custom domain name of ``apis.example.com`` for this API, you can then access the same resource using the URL of the ``https://apis.examples.com/myApi`` , where ``myApi`` is the base path mapping ( BasePathMapping ) of your API under the custom domain name. 

       `Set a Custom Host Name for an API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-custom-domains.html>`__  

    domainName -> (string)

      

      The custom domain name as an API host name, for example, ``my-api.example.com`` .

      

      

    certificateName -> (string)

      

      The name of the certificate that will be used by edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name.

      

      

    certificateArn -> (string)

      

      The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that will be used by edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name. AWS Certificate Manager is the only supported source.

      

      

    certificateUploadDate -> (timestamp)

      

      The timestamp when the certificate that was used by edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name was uploaded.

      

      

    regionalDomainName -> (string)

      

      The domain name associated with the regional endpoint for this custom domain name. You set up this association by adding a DNS record that points the custom domain name to this regional domain name. The regional domain name is returned by API Gateway when you create a regional endpoint.

      

      

    regionalHostedZoneId -> (string)

      

      The region-specific Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone ID of the regional endpoint. For more information, see `Set up a Regional Custom Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-regional-api-custom-domain-create.html>`__ and `AWS Regions and Endpoints for API Gateway <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#apigateway_region>`__ . 

      

      

    regionalCertificateName -> (string)

      

      The name of the certificate that will be used for validating the regional domain name.

      

      

    regionalCertificateArn -> (string)

      

      The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that will be used for validating the regional domain name. AWS Certificate Manager is the only supported source.

      

      

    distributionDomainName -> (string)

      

      The domain name of the Amazon CloudFront distribution associated with this custom domain name for an edge-optimized endpoint. You set up this association when adding a DNS record pointing the custom domain name to this distribution name. For more information about CloudFront distributions, see the `Amazon CloudFront documentation <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cloudfront/>`__ .

      

      

    distributionHostedZoneId -> (string)

      

      The region-agnostic Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone ID of the edge-optimized endpoint. The valid value is ``Z2FDTNDATAQYW2`` for all the regions. For more information, see `Set up a Regional Custom Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-regional-api-custom-domain-create.html>`__ and `AWS Regions and Endpoints for API Gateway <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#apigateway_region>`__ . 

      

      

    endpointConfiguration -> (structure)

      

      The endpoint configuration of this  DomainName showing the endpoint types of the domain name. 

      

      types -> (list)

        

        A list of endpoint types of an API ( RestApi ) or its custom domain name ( DomainName ). For an edge-optimized API and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is ``"EDGE"`` . For a regional API and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is ``REGIONAL`` . For a private API, the endpoint type is ``PRIVATE`` .

        

        (string)

          

          The endpoint type. The valid values are ``EDGE`` for edge-optimized API setup, most suitable for mobile applications; ``REGIONAL`` for regional API endpoint setup, most suitable for calling from AWS Region; and ``PRIVATE`` for private APIs.
