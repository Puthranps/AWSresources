Synopsis

::

    get-domain-name
  --domain-name <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]

Options
=======

``--domain-name`` (string)


  [Required] The name of the  DomainName resource.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Examples
========

**To get information about a custom domain name**

Command::

  aws apigateway get-domain-name --domain-name api.domain.tld

Output::

  {
      "domainName": "api.domain.tld", 
      "distributionDomainName": "d1a2f3a4c5o6d.cloudfront.net", 
      "certificateName": "uploadedCertificate", 
      "certificateUploadDate": 1462565487
  }


======
Output
======

domainName -> (string)

  

  The custom domain name as an API host name, for example, ``my-api.example.com`` .

  

  

certificateName -> (string)

  

  The name of the certificate that will be used by edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name.

  

  

certificateArn -> (string)

  

  The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that will be used by edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name. AWS Certificate Manager is the only supported source.

  

  

certificateUploadDate -> (timestamp)

  

  The timestamp when the certificate that was used by edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name was uploaded.

  

  

regionalDomainName -> (string)

  

  The domain name associated with the regional endpoint for this custom domain name. You set up this association by adding a DNS record that points the custom domain name to this regional domain name. The regional domain name is returned by API Gateway when you create a regional endpoint.

  

  

regionalHostedZoneId -> (string)

  

  The region-specific Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone ID of the regional endpoint. For more information, see `Set up a Regional Custom Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-regional-api-custom-domain-create.html>`__ and `AWS Regions and Endpoints for API Gateway <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#apigateway_region>`__ . 

  

  

regionalCertificateName -> (string)

  

  The name of the certificate that will be used for validating the regional domain name.

  

  

regionalCertificateArn -> (string)

  

  The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that will be used for validating the regional domain name. AWS Certificate Manager is the only supported source.

  

  

distributionDomainName -> (string)

  

  The domain name of the Amazon CloudFront distribution associated with this custom domain name for an edge-optimized endpoint. You set up this association when adding a DNS record pointing the custom domain name to this distribution name. For more information about CloudFront distributions, see the `Amazon CloudFront documentation <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cloudfront/>`__ .

  

  

distributionHostedZoneId -> (string)

  

  The region-agnostic Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone ID of the edge-optimized endpoint. The valid value is ``Z2FDTNDATAQYW2`` for all the regions. For more information, see `Set up a Regional Custom Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-regional-api-custom-domain-create.html>`__ and `AWS Regions and Endpoints for API Gateway <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#apigateway_region>`__ . 

  

  

endpointConfiguration -> (structure)

  

  The endpoint configuration of this  DomainName showing the endpoint types of the domain name. 

  

  types -> (list)

    

    A list of endpoint types of an API ( RestApi ) or its custom domain name ( DomainName ). For an edge-optimized API and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is ``"EDGE"`` . For a regional API and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is ``REGIONAL`` . For a private API, the endpoint type is ``PRIVATE`` .

    

    (string)

      

      The endpoint type. The valid values are ``EDGE`` for edge-optimized API setup, most suitable for mobile applications; ``REGIONAL`` for regional API endpoint setup, most suitable for calling from AWS Region; and ``PRIVATE`` for private APIs.
