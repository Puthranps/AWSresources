Synopsis
========

::

    get-rest-api
  --rest-api-id <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--rest-api-id`` (string)


  [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Examples
========

**To get information about an API**

Command::

  aws apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id 1234123412

Output::

  {
      "name": "myAPI", 
      "id": "o1y243m4f5", 
      "createdDate": 1453416433
  }


======
Output
======

id -> (string)

  

  The API's identifier. This identifier is unique across all of your APIs in API Gateway.

  

  

name -> (string)

  

  The API's name.

  

  

description -> (string)

  

  The API's description.

  

  

createdDate -> (timestamp)

  

  The timestamp when the API was created.

  

  

version -> (string)

  

  A version identifier for the API.

  

  

warnings -> (list)

  

  The warning messages reported when ``failonwarnings`` is turned on during API import.

  

  (string)

    

    

  

binaryMediaTypes -> (list)

  

  The list of binary media types supported by the  RestApi . By default, the  RestApi supports only UTF-8-encoded text payloads.

  

  (string)

    

    

  

minimumCompressionSize -> (integer)

  

  A nullable integer that is used to enable compression (with non-negative between 0 and 10485760 (10M) bytes, inclusive) or disable compression (with a null value) on an API. When compression is enabled, compression or decompression is not applied on the payload if the payload size is smaller than this value. Setting it to zero allows compression for any payload size.

  

  

apiKeySource -> (string)

  

  The source of the API key for metering requests according to a usage plan. Valid values are: 

  
  * ``HEADER`` to read the API key from the ``X-API-Key`` header of a request. 
  
  * ``AUTHORIZER`` to read the API key from the ``UsageIdentifierKey`` from a custom authorizer.
  

   

  

  

endpointConfiguration -> (structure)

  

  The endpoint configuration of this  RestApi showing the endpoint types of the API. 

  

  types -> (list)

    

    A list of endpoint types of an API ( RestApi ) or its custom domain name ( DomainName ). For an edge-optimized API and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is ``"EDGE"`` . For a regional API and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is ``REGIONAL`` . For a private API, the endpoint type is ``PRIVATE`` .

    

    (string)

      

      The endpoint type. The valid values are ``EDGE`` for edge-optimized API setup, most suitable for mobile applications; ``REGIONAL`` for regional API endpoint setup, most suitable for calling from AWS Region; and ``PRIVATE`` for private APIs.

      

      

    

  

policy -> (string)

  A stringified JSON policy document that applies to this RestApi regardless of the caller and  Method configuration.
