=======
Options
=======

``--name`` (string)


  A user-supplied name for the ``GraphqlApi`` .

  

``--log-config`` (structure)


  The Amazon CloudWatch logs configuration.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    fieldLogLevel=string,cloudWatchLogsRoleArn=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "fieldLogLevel": "NONE"|"ERROR"|"ALL",
    "cloudWatchLogsRoleArn": "string"
  }



``--authentication-type`` (string)


  The authentication type: API key, IAM, or Amazon Cognito User Pools.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``API_KEY``

  
  *   ``AWS_IAM``

  
  *   ``AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS``

  
  *   ``OPENID_CONNECT``

  

  

``--user-pool-config`` (structure)


  The Amazon Cognito User Pool configuration.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    userPoolId=string,awsRegion=string,defaultAction=string,appIdClientRegex=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "userPoolId": "string",
    "awsRegion": "string",
    "defaultAction": "ALLOW"|"DENY",
    "appIdClientRegex": "string"
  }



``--open-id-connect-config`` (structure)


  The Open Id Connect configuration configuration.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    issuer=string,clientId=string,iatTTL=long,authTTL=long




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "issuer": "string",
    "clientId": "string",
    "iatTTL": long,
    "authTTL": long
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
