Synopsis

    list-data-sources
  --api-id <value>
  [--next-token <value>]

  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--api-id`` (string)


  The API ID.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this operation, which can be used to return the next set of items in the list. 

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results you want the request to return.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
