===========
Description
===========



Lists the API keys for a given API.

 

.. note::

   

  API keys are deleted automatically sometime after they expire. However, they may still be included in the response until they have actually been deleted. You can safely call ``DeleteApiKey`` to manually delete a key before it's automatically deleted.

=======
Options
=======

``--api-id`` (string)


  The API ID.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this operation, which can be used to return the next set of items in the list.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results you want the request to return.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output

apiKeys -> (list)

  

  The ``ApiKey`` objects.

  

  (structure)

    

    Describes an API key.

     

    Customers invoke AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs with API keys as an identity mechanism. There are two key versions:

     

     **da1** : This version was introduced at launch in November 2017. These keys always expire after 7 days. Key expiration is managed by DynamoDB TTL. The keys will cease to be valid after Feb 21, 2018 and should not be used after that date.

     

     
    * ``ListApiKeys`` returns the expiration time in milliseconds. 
     
    * ``CreateApiKey`` returns the expiration time in milliseconds. 
     
    * ``UpdateApiKey`` is not available for this key version. 
     
    * ``DeleteApiKey`` deletes the item from the table. 
     
    * Expiration is stored in DynamoDB as milliseconds. This results in a bug where keys are not automatically deleted because DynamoDB expects the TTL to be stored in seconds. As a one-time action, we will delete these keys from the table after Feb 21, 2018. 
     

     

     **da2** : This version was introduced in February 2018 when AppSync added support to extend key expiration.

     

     
    * ``ListApiKeys`` returns the expiration time in seconds. 
     
    * ``CreateApiKey`` returns the expiration time in seconds and accepts a user-provided expiration time in seconds. 
     
    * ``UpdateApiKey`` returns the expiration time in seconds and accepts a user-provided expiration time in seconds. Key expiration can only be updated while the key has not expired. 
     
    * ``DeleteApiKey`` deletes the item from the table. 
     
    * Expiration is stored in DynamoDB as seconds. 
     

    

    id -> (string)

      

      The API key ID.

      

      

    description -> (string)

      

      A description of the purpose of the API key.

      

      

    expires -> (long)

      

      The time after which the API key expires. The date is represented as seconds since the epoch, rounded down to the nearest hour.

      

      

    

  

nextToken -> (string)

  

  An identifier to be passed in the next request to this operation to return the next set of items in the list.
