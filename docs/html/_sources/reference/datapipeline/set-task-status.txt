===========
Description
===========



Task runners call ``SetTaskStatus`` to notify AWS Data Pipeline that a task is completed and provide information about the final status. A task runner makes this call regardless of whether the task was sucessful. A task runner does not need to call ``SetTaskStatus`` for tasks that are canceled by the web service during a call to  ReportTaskProgress .

=======
Options
=======

``--task-id`` (string)


  The ID of the task assigned to the task runner. This value is provided in the response for  PollForTask .

  

``--task-status`` (string)


  If ``FINISHED`` , the task successfully completed. If ``FAILED`` , the task ended unsuccessfully. Preconditions use false.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``FINISHED``

  
  *   ``FAILED``

  
  *   ``FALSE``

  

  

``--error-id`` (string)


  If an error occurred during the task, this value specifies the error code. This value is set on the physical attempt object. It is used to display error information to the user. It should not start with string "Service_" which is reserved by the system.

  

``--error-message`` (string)


  If an error occurred during the task, this value specifies a text description of the error. This value is set on the physical attempt object. It is used to display error information to the user. The web service does not parse this value.

  

``--error-stack-trace`` (string)


  If an error occurred during the task, this value specifies the stack trace associated with the error. This value is set on the physical attempt object. It is used to display error information to the user. The web service does not parse this value.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
