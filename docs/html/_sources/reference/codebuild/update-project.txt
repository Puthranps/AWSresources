``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

project -> (structure)

  

  Information about the build project that was changed.

  

  name -> (string)

    

    The name of the build project.

    

    

  arn -> (string)

    

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the build project.

    

    

  description -> (string)

    

    A description that makes the build project easy to identify.

    

    

  source -> (structure)

    

    Information about the build input source code for this build project.

    

    type -> (string)

      

      The type of repository that contains the source code to be built. Valid values include:

       

       
      * ``BITBUCKET`` : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository. 
       
      * ``CODECOMMIT`` : The source code is in an AWS CodeCommit repository. 
       
      * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The source code settings are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline. 
       
      * ``GITHUB`` : The source code is in a GitHub repository. 
       
      * ``NO_SOURCE`` : The project does not have input source code. 
       
      * ``S3`` : The source code is in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) input bucket. 
       

      

      

    location -> (string)

      

      Information about the location of the source code to be built. Valid values include:

       

       
      * For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, ``location`` should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline will ignore it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. 
       
      * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the build spec (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.*region-ID* .amazonaws.com/v1/repos/*repo-name* `` ). 
       
      * For source code in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) input bucket, the path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, `` *bucket-name* /*path* /*to* /*object-name* .zip`` ) 
       
      * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page that displays, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to. Then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
       
      * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page that displays, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
       

      

      

    gitCloneDepth -> (integer)

      

      Information about the git clone depth for the build project.

    auth -> (structure)

      

      Information about the authorization settings for AWS CodeBuild to access the source code to be built.

       

      This information is for the AWS CodeBuild console's use only. Your code should not get or set this information directly (unless the build project's source ``type`` value is ``BITBUCKET`` or ``GITHUB`` ).

      

      type -> (string)

        

        The authorization type to use. The only valid value is ``OAUTH`` , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

        

        

      resource -> (string)

        

        The resource value that applies to the specified authorization type.

        

        

      

    reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)

      

      Set to true to report the status of a build's start and finish to your source provider. This option is only valid when your source provider is GitHub. If this is set and you use a different source provider, an invalidInputException is thrown. 

      

      

    insecureSsl -> (boolean)

      

      Enable this flag to ignore SSL warnings while connecting to the project source code.

        An identifier for this project source. 

        

        

      

    

  artifacts -> (structure)

    

    Information about the build output artifacts for the build project.

    

    type -> (string)

      

      The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

       

       
      * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project will have build output generated through AWS CodePipeline. 
       
      * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project will not produce any build output. 
       
      * ``S3`` : The build project will store build output in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). 
       

      

      

    location -> (string)

      

      Information about the build output artifact location, as follows:

       

       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
       

      

      

    path -> (string)

      

      Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

       

       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, then ``path`` will not be used. 
       

       

      For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

      

      

    namespaceType -> (string)

      

      Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to determine the name and location to store the output artifact, as follows:

       

       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , then valid values include: 

         
        * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
         
        * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
         

       
       

       

      For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .

      

      

    name -> (string)

      

      Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

       

       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. If you set the name to be a forward slash ("/"), then the artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket. 
       

       

      For example:

       

       
      * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .  
       
      * If ``path`` is empty, ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", then the output artifact would be stored in the root of the output bucket.  
       
      * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* `` .  
       

      

      

    packaging -> (string)

      

      The type of build output artifact to create, as follows:

       

       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
       
      * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

         
        * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild will create in the output bucket a folder containing the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
         
        * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild will create in the output bucket a ZIP file containing the build output. 
         

       
       

      

      

    overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)

      

      If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

      

      

    encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)

      

      Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts encrypted. This option is only valid if your artifacts type is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an invalidInputException will be thrown. 

      

      

    artifactIdentifier -> (string)

      

      An identifier for this artifact definition. 

      

      

    

  secondaryArtifacts -> (list)

    

    An array of ``ProjectArtifacts`` objects. 

    

    (structure)

      

      Information about the build output artifacts for the build project.

      

      type -> (string)

        

        The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project will have build output generated through AWS CodePipeline. 
         
        * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project will not produce any build output. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The build project will store build output in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). 
         

        

        

      location -> (string)

        

        Information about the build output artifact location, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
         

        

        

      path -> (string)

        

        Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, then ``path`` will not be used. 
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

        

      namespaceType -> (string)

        

        Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to determine the name and location to store the output artifact, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , then valid values include: 

           
          * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
           
          * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
           

         
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

        

      name -> (string)

        

        Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. If you set the name to be a forward slash ("/"), then the artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket. 
         

         

        For example:

         

         
        * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .  
         
        * If ``path`` is empty, ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", then the output artifact would be stored in the root of the output bucket.  
         
        * If ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to "``/`` ", then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* `` .  
         

        

        

      packaging -> (string)

        

        The type of build output artifact to create, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

           
          * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild will create in the output bucket a folder containing the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
           
          * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild will create in the output bucket a ZIP file containing the build output. 
           

         
         

        

        

      overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)

        

        If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique. 

        

        

      encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)

        

        Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts encrypted. This option is only valid if your artifacts type is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an invalidInputException will be thrown.

      * ``NO_CACHE`` : The build project will not use any cache. 
       
      * ``S3`` : The build project will read and write from/to S3. 
       

      

      

    location -> (string)

      

      Information about the cache location, as follows: 

       

       
      * ``NO_CACHE`` : This value will be ignored. 
       
      * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix.

          .. warning::

             

            We strongly discourage using environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. Environment variables can be displayed in plain text using tools such as the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

    privilegedMode -> (boolean)

      

      Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is be used to build Docker images, and the specified build environment image is not provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support. Otherwise, all associated builds that attempt to interact with the Docker daemon will fail. Note that you must also start the Docker daemon so that builds can interact with it. One way to do this is to initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build spec by running the following build commands. (Do not run the following build commands if the specified build environment image is provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support.)

       

      If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:

       

       ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay& - timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

       

      If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux, add the ``-t`` argument to ``timeout`` :

       

       ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay& - timeout 15 -t sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``
