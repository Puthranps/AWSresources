=======
Options
=======

``--project-name`` (string)


  The name of the AWS CodeBuild project.

  

``--branch-filter`` (string)


  A regular expression used to determine which branches in a repository are built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a branch matches the regular expression, then it is built. If it doesn't match, then it is not. If branchFilter is empty, then all branches are built.

  

``--rotate-secret`` | ``--no-rotate-secret`` (boolean)


  A boolean value that specifies whether the associated repository's secret token should be updated. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
