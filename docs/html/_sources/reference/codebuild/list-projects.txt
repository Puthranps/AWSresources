===========
Description
===========



Gets a list of build project names, with each build project name representing a single build project.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``list-projects`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``projects``

Options
=======

``--sort-by`` (string)


  The criterion to be used to list build project names. Valid values include:

   

   
  * ``CREATED_TIME`` : List the build project names based on when each build project was created. 
   
  * ``LAST_MODIFIED_TIME`` : List the build project names based on when information about each build project was last changed. 
   
  * ``NAME`` : List the build project names based on each build project's name. 
   

   

  Use ``sortOrder`` to specify in what order to list the build project names based on the preceding criteria.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``NAME``

  
  *   ``CREATED_TIME``

  
  *   ``LAST_MODIFIED_TIME``

  

  

``--sort-order`` (string)


  The order in which to list build projects. Valid values include:

   

   
  * ``ASCENDING`` : List the build project names in ascending order. 
   
  * ``DESCENDING`` : List the build project names in descending order. 
   

   

  Use ``sortBy`` to specify the criterion to be used to list build project names.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``ASCENDING``

  
  *   ``DESCENDING``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

nextToken -> (string)

  

  If there are more than 100 items in the list, only the first 100 items are returned, along with a unique string called a *next token* . To get the next batch of items in the list, call this operation again, adding the next token to the call.

  

  

projects -> (list)

  

  The list of build project names, with each build project name representing a single build project.

  

  (string)
