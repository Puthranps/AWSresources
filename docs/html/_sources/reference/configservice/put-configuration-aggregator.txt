put-configuration-aggregator
****************************



===========
Description
===========



Creates and updates the configuration aggregator with the selected source accounts and regions. The source account can be individual account(s) or an organization.

 

.. note::

   

  AWS Config should be enabled in source accounts and regions you want to aggregate.

   

  If your source type is an organization, you must be signed in to the master account and all features must be enabled in your organization. AWS Config calls ``EnableAwsServiceAccess`` API to enable integration between AWS Config and AWS Organizations.

``--configuration-aggregator-name`` (string)


  The name of the configuration aggregator.

  

``--account-aggregation-sources`` (list)


  A list of AccountAggregationSource object. 

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    AccountIds=string,string,AllAwsRegions=boolean,AwsRegions=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "AccountIds": ["string", ...],
      "AllAwsRegions": true|false,
      "AwsRegions": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--organization-aggregation-source`` (structure)


  An OrganizationAggregationSource object.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    RoleArn=string,AwsRegions=string,string,AllAwsRegions=boolean




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "RoleArn": "string",
    "AwsRegions": ["string", ...],
    "AllAwsRegions": true|false
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
