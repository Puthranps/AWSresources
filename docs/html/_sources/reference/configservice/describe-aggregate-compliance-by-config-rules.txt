=======
Options
=======

``--configuration-aggregator-name`` (string)


  The name of the configuration aggregator.

  

``--filters`` (structure)


  Filters the results by ConfigRuleComplianceFilters object. 

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    ConfigRuleName=string,ComplianceType=string,AccountId=string,AwsRegion=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "ConfigRuleName": "string",
    "ComplianceType": "COMPLIANT"|"NON_COMPLIANT"|"NOT_APPLICABLE"|"INSUFFICIENT_DATA",
    "AccountId": "string",
    "AwsRegion": "string"
  }



``--limit`` (integer)


  The maximum number of evaluation results returned on each page. The default is maximum. If you specify 0, AWS Config uses the default.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get the next page of results in a paginated response.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output
======

AggregateComplianceByConfigRules -> (list)

  

  Returns a list of AggregateComplianceByConfigRule object.

  

  (structure)

    

    Indicates whether an AWS Config rule is compliant based on account ID, region, compliance, and rule name.

     

    A rule is compliant if all of the resources that the rule evaluated comply with it. It is noncompliant if any of these resources do not comply.

    

    ConfigRuleName -> (string)

      

      The name of the AWS Config rule.

      

      

    Compliance -> (structure)

      

      Indicates whether an AWS resource or AWS Config rule is compliant and provides the number of contributors that affect the compliance.

      

      ComplianceType -> (string)

        

        Indicates whether an AWS resource or AWS Config rule is compliant.

         

        A resource is compliant if it complies with all of the AWS Config rules that evaluate it. A resource is noncompliant if it does not comply with one or more of these rules.

         

        A rule is compliant if all of the resources that the rule evaluates comply with it. A rule is noncompliant if any of these resources do not comply.

         

        AWS Config returns the ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` value when no evaluation results are available for the AWS resource or AWS Config rule.

         

        For the ``Compliance`` data type, AWS Config supports only ``COMPLIANT`` , ``NON_COMPLIANT`` , and ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` values. AWS Config does not support the ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` value for the ``Compliance`` data type.

        

        

      ComplianceContributorCount -> (structure)

        

        The number of AWS resources or AWS Config rules that cause a result of ``NON_COMPLIANT`` , up to a maximum number.

        

        CappedCount -> (integer)

          

          The number of AWS resources or AWS Config rules responsible for the current compliance of the item.

          

          

        CapExceeded -> (boolean)

          

          Indicates whether the maximum count is reached.

          

          

        

      

    AccountId -> (string)

      

      The 12-digit account ID of the source account.

      

      

    AwsRegion -> (string)

      

      The source region from where the data is aggregated.

      

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get the next page of results in a paginated response.
