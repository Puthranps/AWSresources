=======
Options
=======

``--configuration-aggregator-name`` (string)


  The name of the configuration aggregator.

  

``--filters`` (structure)


  Filters the results based on the ConfigRuleComplianceSummaryFilters object.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    AccountId=string,AwsRegion=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "AccountId": "string",
    "AwsRegion": "string"
  }



``--group-by-key`` (string)


  Groups the result based on ACCOUNT_ID or AWS_REGION.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``ACCOUNT_ID``

  
  *   ``AWS_REGION``

  

  

``--limit`` (integer)


  The maximum number of evaluation results returned on each page. The default is 1000. You cannot specify a number greater than 1000. If you specify 0, AWS Config uses the default.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get the next page of results in a paginated response.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
