===========
Description
===========



Returns the evaluation results for the specified AWS Config rule for a specific resource in a rule. The results indicate which AWS resources were evaluated by the rule, when each resource was last evaluated, and whether each resource complies with the rule. 

 

.. note::

   

  The results can return an empty result page. But if you have a nextToken, the results are displayed on the next page.

=======
Options
=======

``--configuration-aggregator-name`` (string)


  The name of the configuration aggregator.

  

``--config-rule-name`` (string)


  The name of the AWS Config rule for which you want compliance information.

  

``--account-id`` (string)


  The 12-digit account ID of the source account.

  

``--aws-region`` (string)


  The source region from where the data is aggregated.

  

``--compliance-type`` (string)


  The resource compliance status.

   

  .. note::

     

    For the ``GetAggregateComplianceDetailsByConfigRuleRequest`` data type, AWS Config supports only the ``COMPLIANT`` and ``NON_COMPLIANT`` . AWS Config does not support the ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` and ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` values.

     

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``COMPLIANT``

  
  *   ``NON_COMPLIANT``

  
  *   ``NOT_APPLICABLE``

  
  *   ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA``

  

  

``--limit`` (integer)


  The maximum number of evaluation results returned on each page. The default is 50. You cannot specify a number greater than 100. If you specify 0, AWS Config uses the default.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get the next page of results in a paginated response.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
