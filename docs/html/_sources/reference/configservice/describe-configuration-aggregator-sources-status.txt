Options

``--configuration-aggregator-name`` (string)


  The name of the configuration aggregator.

  

``--update-status`` (list)


  Filters the status type.

   

   
  * Valid value FAILED indicates errors while moving data. 
   
  * Valid value SUCCEEDED indicates the data was successfully moved. 
   
  * Valid value OUTDATED indicates the data is not the most recent. 
   

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...

  Where valid values are:
    FAILED
    SUCCEEDED
    OUTDATED





``--next-token`` (string)


  The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get the next page of results in a paginated response.

  

``--limit`` (integer)


  The maximum number of AggregatorSourceStatus returned on each page. The default is maximum. If you specify 0, AWS Config uses the default.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
