=======
Options
=======

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--client-token`` (string)


  A unique, case-sensitive token that you provide to ensure idempotency of your modification request. For more information, see `Ensuring Idempotency <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html>`__ .

  

``--instance-credit-specifications`` (list)


  Information about the credit option for CPU usage.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    InstanceId=string,CpuCredits=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "InstanceId": "string",
      "CpuCredits": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

      {
        "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0"
      }
    ], 
    "UnsuccessfulInstanceCreditSpecifications": []
  }
