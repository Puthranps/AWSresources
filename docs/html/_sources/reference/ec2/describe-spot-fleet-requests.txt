Description
===========



Describes your Spot Fleet requests.

 

Spot Fleet requests are deleted 48 hours after they are canceled and their instances are terminated.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ec2-2016-11-15/DescribeSpotFleetRequests>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``describe-spot-fleet-requests`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``SpotFleetRequestConfigs``

  [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
  [--spot-fleet-request-ids <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--spot-fleet-request-ids`` (list)


  The IDs of the Spot Fleet requests.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

  Information about the configuration of your Spot Fleet.

  

  (structure)

    

    Describes a Spot Fleet request.

    

    ActivityStatus -> (string)

      

      The progress of the Spot Fleet request. If there is an error, the status is ``error`` . After all requests are placed, the status is ``pending_fulfillment`` . If the size of the fleet is equal to or greater than its target capacity, the status is ``fulfilled`` . If the size of the fleet is decreased, the status is ``pending_termination`` while Spot Instances are terminating.

      

      

    CreateTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The creation date and time of the request.

If you specify ``lowestPrice`` , Spot Fleet uses price to determine the order, launching the lowest price first. If you specify ``prioritized`` , Spot Fleet uses the priority that you assign to each Spot Fleet launch template override, launching the highest priority first. If you do not specify a value, Spot Fleet defaults to ``lowestPrice`` .

        

        

      ClientToken -> (string)

        

        A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of your listings. This helps to avoid duplicate listings. For more information, see `Ensuring Idempotency <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html>`__ .

        

        

      ExcessCapacityTerminationPolicy -> (string)

        

        Indicates whether running Spot Instances should be terminated if the target capacity of the Spot Fleet request is decreased below the current size of the Spot Fleet.

      LaunchSpecifications -> (list)

        

        The launch specifications for the Spot Fleet request.

        

        (structure)

          

          Describes the launch specification for one or more Spot Instances.

          

          SecurityGroups -> (list)

            

            One or more security groups. When requesting instances in a VPC, you must specify the IDs of the security groups. When requesting instances in EC2-Classic, you can specify the names or the IDs of the security groups.

                The name of the security group.

                

                

              GroupId -> (string)

                

                The ID of the security group.

                

                

              

            

          AddressingType -> (string)

            

            Deprecated.

            

            

          BlockDeviceMappings -> (list)

            

            One or more block device mapping entries. You can't specify both a snapshot ID and an encryption value. This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on creation. If a snapshot is the basis for a volume, it is not blank and its encryption status is used for the volume encryption status.

            

            (structure)

              

              Describes a block device mapping.

              

              DeviceName -> (string)

                

                The device name (for example, ``/dev/sdh`` or ``xvdh`` ).

                

                

              VirtualName -> (string)

                

                The virtual device name (``ephemeral`` N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ``ephemeral0`` and ``ephemeral1`` . The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                 

                NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

                 

                Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

                

                

              Ebs -> (structure)

                

                Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched.

                

                DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)

                  

                  Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination.

                  

                  

                Iops -> (integer)

                  

                  The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the volume supports. For ``io1`` , this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For ``gp2`` , this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting. For more information about General Purpose SSD baseline performance, I/O credits, and bursting, see `Amazon EBS Volume Types <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide* .

                   

                  Constraint: Range is 100-20000 IOPS for ``io1`` volumes and 100-10000 IOPS for ``gp2`` volumes.

                   

                  Condition: This parameter is required for requests to create ``io1`` volumes; it is not used in requests to create ``gp2`` , ``st1`` , ``sc1`` , or ``standard`` volumes.

                  

                  

                SnapshotId -> (string)

                  

                  The ID of the snapshot.

                  

                  

                VolumeSize -> (integer)

                  

                  The size of the volume, in GiB.

                   

                  Constraints: 1-16384 for General Purpose SSD (``gp2`` ), 4-16384 for Provisioned IOPS SSD (``io1`` ), 500-16384 for Throughput Optimized HDD (``st1`` ), 500-16384 for Cold HDD (``sc1`` ), and 1-1024 for Magnetic (``standard`` ) volumes. If you specify a snapshot, the volume size must be equal to or larger than the snapshot size.

                   

                  Default: If you're creating the volume from a snapshot and don't specify a volume size, the default is the snapshot size.

                  

                  

                VolumeType -> (string)

                  

                  The volume type: ``gp2`` , ``io1`` , ``st1`` , ``sc1`` , or ``standard`` .

                   

                  Default: ``standard``  

                  

                  

                Encrypted -> (boolean)

                  

                  Indicates whether the EBS volume is encrypted. Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. 

                   

                  If you are creating a volume from a snapshot, you cannot specify an encryption value. This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on creation. If you are creating a snapshot from an existing EBS volume, you cannot specify an encryption value that differs from that of the EBS volume. We recommend that you omit the encryption value from the block device mappings when creating an image from an instance.
