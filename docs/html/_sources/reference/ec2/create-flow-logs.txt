===========
Description
===========



Creates one or more flow logs to capture information about IP traffic for a specific network interface, subnet, or VPC. 

 

Flow log data for a monitored network interface is recorded as flow log records, which are log events consisting of fields that describe the traffic flow. For more information, see `Flow Log Records <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html#flow-log-records>`__ in the *Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide* .

 

When publishing to CloudWatch Logs, flow log records are published to a log group, and each network interface has a unique log stream in the log group. When publishing to Amazon S3, flow log records for all of the monitored network interfaces are published to a single log file object that is stored in the specified bucket.

 

For more information, see `VPC Flow Logs <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html>`__ in the *Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide* .

=======
Options
=======

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--client-token`` (string)


  Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see `How to Ensure Idempotency <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html>`__ .

  

``--deliver-logs-permission-arn`` (string)


  The ARN for the IAM role that's used to post flow logs to a log group.

  

``--log-group-name`` (string)


  The name of the log group.

  

``--resource-ids`` (list)


  One or more subnet, network interface, or VPC IDs.

   

  Constraints: Maximum of 1000 resources

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--resource-type`` (string)


  The type of resource on which to create the flow log.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``VPC``

  
  *   ``Subnet``

  
  *   ``NetworkInterface``

  

  

``--traffic-type`` (string)


  The type of traffic to log.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``ACCEPT``

  
  *   ``REJECT``

  
  *   ``ALL``

  

  

``--log-destination-type`` (string)


  Specifies the type of destination to which the flow log data is to be published. Flow log data can be published to CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3. To publish flow log data to CloudWatch Logs, specify ``cloud-watch-logs`` . To publish flow log data to Amazon S3, specify ``s3`` .

   

  Default: ``cloud-watch-logs``  

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``cloud-watch-logs``

  
  *   ``s3``

  

  

``--log-destination`` (string)


  Specifies the destination to which the flow log data is to be published. Flow log data can be published to an CloudWatch Logs log group or an Amazon S3 bucket. The value specified for this parameter depends on the value specified for LogDestinationType.

   

  If LogDestinationType is not specified or ``cloud-watch-logs`` , specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudWatch Logs log group.

   

  If LogDestinationType is ``s3`` , specify the ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket. You can also specify a subfolder in the bucket. To specify a subfolder in the bucket, use the following ARN format: ``bucket_ARN/subfolder_name/`` . For example, to specify a subfolder named ``my-logs`` in a bucket named ``my-bucket`` , use the following ARN: ``arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/my-logs/`` . You cannot use ``AWSLogs`` as a subfolder name. This is a reserved term.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Examples
========

**To create a flow log**

This example creates a flow log that captures all rejected traffic for network interface ``eni-aa22bb33``. The flow logs are delivered to a log group in CloudWatch Logs called ``my-flow-logs`` in account 123456789101, using the IAM role ``publishFlowLogs``.

Command::

  aws ec2 create-flow-logs --resource-type NetworkInterface --resource-ids eni-aa22bb33 --traffic-type REJECT --log-group-name my-flow-logs --deliver-logs-permission-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789101:role/publishFlowLogs

Output::

  {
    "Unsuccessful": [], 
    "FlowLogIds": [
      "fl-1a2b3c4d"
    ], 
    "ClientToken": "lO+mDZGO+HCFEXAMPLEfWNO00bInKkBcLfrC"
  }
