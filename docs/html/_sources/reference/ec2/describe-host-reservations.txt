  One or more filters.

   

   
  * ``instance-family`` - The instance family (for example, ``m4`` ). 
   
  * ``payment-option`` - The payment option (``NoUpfront`` | ``PartialUpfront`` | ``AllUpfront`` ). 
   
  * ``state`` - The state of the reservation (``payment-pending`` | ``payment-failed`` | ``active`` | ``retired`` ).

  [
    {
      "Name": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--host-reservation-id-set`` (list)


  One or more host reservation IDs.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results can be seen by sending another request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 5 and 500. If ``maxResults`` is given a larger value than 500, you receive an error.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
