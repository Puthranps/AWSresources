===========
Description
===========



Creates a placement group in which to launch instances. The strategy of the placement group determines how the instances are organized within the group. 

 

A ``cluster`` placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput. A ``spread`` placement group places instances on distinct hardware.

 

For more information, see `Placement Groups <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide* .

Synopsis

::

    create-placement-group
  [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
  --group-name <value>
  --strategy <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--group-name`` (string)


  A name for the placement group. Must be unique within the scope of your account for the region.

   

  Constraints: Up to 255 ASCII characters

  

``--strategy`` (string)


  The placement strategy.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``cluster``

  
  *   ``spread``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
