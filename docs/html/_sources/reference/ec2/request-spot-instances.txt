Options
=======

``--availability-zone-group`` (string)


  The user-specified name for a logical grouping of requests.

   

  When you specify an Availability Zone group in a Spot Instance request, all Spot Instances in the request are launched in the same Availability Zone. Instance proximity is maintained with this parameter, but the choice of Availability Zone is not. The group applies only to requests for Spot Instances of the same instance type. Any additional Spot Instance requests that are specified with the same Availability Zone group name are launched in that same Availability Zone, as long as at least one instance from the group is still active.

   

  If there is no active instance running in the Availability Zone group that you specify for a new Spot Instance request (all instances are terminated, the request is expired, or the maximum price you specified falls below current Spot price), then Amazon EC2 launches the instance in any Availability Zone where the constraint can be met. Consequently, the subsequent set of Spot Instances could be placed in a different zone from the original request, even if you specified the same Availability Zone group.

   

  Default: Instances are launched in any available Availability Zone.

  

``--block-duration-minutes`` (integer)


  The required duration for the Spot Instances (also known as Spot blocks), in minutes. This value must be a multiple of 60 (60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360).

   

  The duration period starts as soon as your Spot Instance receives its instance ID. At the end of the duration period, Amazon EC2 marks the Spot Instance for termination and provides a Spot Instance termination notice, which gives the instance a two-minute warning before it terminates.

   

  You can't specify an Availability Zone group or a launch group if you specify a duration.

  

``--client-token`` (string)


  Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see `How to Ensure Idempotency <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* .

  

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--instance-count`` (integer)


  The maximum number of Spot Instances to launch.

   

  Default: 1

  

``--launch-group`` (string)


  The instance launch group. Launch groups are Spot Instances that launch together and terminate together.

   

  Default: Instances are launched and terminated individually

  

``--launch-specification`` (structure)


  The launch specification.

``--spot-price`` (string)


  The maximum price per hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance. The default is the On-Demand price.

  

``--type`` (string)


  The Spot Instance request type.

   

  Default: ``one-time``  

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``one-time``

  
  *   ``persistent``

  

  

``--valid-from`` (timestamp)


  The start date of the request. If this is a one-time request, the request becomes active at this date and time and remains active until all instances launch, the request expires, or the request is canceled. If the request is persistent, the request becomes active at this date and time and remains active until it expires or is canceled.

  

``--valid-until`` (timestamp)


  The end date of the request. If this is a one-time request, the request remains active until all instances launch, the request is canceled, or this date is reached. If the request is persistent, it remains active until it is canceled or this date is reached. The default end date is 7 days from the current date.

  

``--instance-interruption-behavior`` (string)


  The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted. The default is ``terminate`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``hibernate``

  
  *   ``stop``

  
  *   ``terminate``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

**To request Spot Instances**

This example command creates a one-time Spot Instance request for five instances in the specified Availability Zone.
If your account supports EC2-VPC only, Amazon EC2 launches the instances in the default subnet of the specified Availability Zone.
If your account supports EC2-Classic, Amazon EC2 launches the instances in EC2-Classic in the specified Availability Zone.

          VirtualName -> (string)

            

            The virtual device name (``ephemeral`` N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ``ephemeral0`` and ``ephemeral1`` . The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

             

            NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

             

            Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

              Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination.

              

              

            Iops -> (integer)

              

              The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the volume supports. For ``io1`` , this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For ``gp2`` , this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting. For more information about General Purpose SSD baseline performance, I/O credits, and bursting, see `Amazon EBS Volume Types <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide* .

               

              Constraint: Range is 100-20000 IOPS for ``io1`` volumes and 100-10000 IOPS for ``gp2`` volumes.

               

              Condition: This parameter is required for requests to create ``io1`` volumes; it is not used in requests to create ``gp2`` , ``st1`` , ``sc1`` , or ``standard`` volumes.

              The size of the volume, in GiB.

               

              Constraints: 1-16384 for General Purpose SSD (``gp2`` ), 4-16384 for Provisioned IOPS SSD (``io1`` ), 500-16384 for Throughput Optimized HDD (``st1`` ), 500-16384 for Cold HDD (``sc1`` ), and 1-1024 for Magnetic (``standard`` ) volumes. If you specify a snapshot, the volume size must be equal to or larger than the snapshot size.

               

              Default: If you're creating the volume from a snapshot and don't specify a volume size, the default is the snapshot size.

              

              

            VolumeType -> (string)

              If you are creating a volume from a snapshot, you cannot specify an encryption value. This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on creation. If you are creating a snapshot from an existing EBS volume, you cannot specify an encryption value that differs from that of the EBS volume. We recommend that you omit the encryption value from the block device mappings when creating an image from an instance.
