Options

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--event-type`` (string)


  The type of events to describe. By default, all events are described.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``instance-change``

  
  *   ``fleet-change``

  
  *   ``service-error``

  

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to return in a single call. Specify a value between 1 and 1000. The default value is 1000. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned ``NextToken`` value.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token for the next set of results.

  

``--fleet-id`` (string)


  The ID of the EC2 Fleet.

  

``--start-time`` (timestamp)


  The start date and time for the events, in UTC format (for example, *YYYY* -*MM* -*DD* T*HH* :*MM* :*SS* Z).

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

HistoryRecords -> (list)

  

  Information about the events in the history of the EC2 Fleet.

  

  (structure)

    

    Describes an event in the history of an EC2 Fleet.

    

    EventInformation -> (structure)

      

      Information about the event.

      

      EventDescription -> (string)

        

        The description of the event.

        

        

      EventSubType -> (string)

        

        The event.

         

        The following are the ``error`` events:

         

         
        * ``iamFleetRoleInvalid`` - The Spot Fleet did not have the required permissions either to launch or terminate an instance. 
         
        * ``launchSpecTemporarilyBlacklisted`` - The configuration is not valid and several attempts to launch instances have failed. For more information, see the description of the event. 
         
        * ``spotFleetRequestConfigurationInvalid`` - The configuration is not valid. For more information, see the description of the event. 
         
        * ``spotInstanceCountLimitExceeded`` - You've reached the limit on the number of Spot Instances that you can launch. 
         

         

        The following are the ``fleetRequestChange`` events:

         

         
        * ``active`` - The Spot Fleet has been validated and Amazon EC2 is attempting to maintain the target number of running Spot Instances. 
         
        * ``cancelled`` - The Spot Fleet is canceled and has no running Spot Instances. The Spot Fleet will be deleted two days after its instances were terminated. 
         
        * ``cancelled_running`` - The Spot Fleet is canceled and does not launch additional Spot Instances. Existing Spot Instances continue to run until they are interrupted or terminated. 
         
        * ``cancelled_terminating`` - The Spot Fleet is canceled and its Spot Instances are terminating. 
         
        * ``expired`` - The Spot Fleet request has expired. A subsequent event indicates that the instances were terminated, if the request was created with ``TerminateInstancesWithExpiration`` set. 
         
        * ``modify_in_progress`` - A request to modify the Spot Fleet request was accepted and is in progress. 
         
        * ``modify_successful`` - The Spot Fleet request was modified. 
         
        * ``price_update`` - The price for a launch configuration was adjusted because it was too high. This change is permanent. 
         
        * ``submitted`` - The Spot Fleet request is being evaluated and Amazon EC2 is preparing to launch the target number of Spot Instances. 
         

         

        The following are the ``instanceChange`` events:

         

         
        * ``launched`` - A request was fulfilled and a new instance was launched. 
         
        * ``terminated`` - An instance was terminated by the user. 
         

         

        The following are the ``Information`` events:

         

         
        * ``launchSpecUnusable`` - The price in a launch specification is not valid because it is below the Spot price or the Spot price is above the On-Demand price. 
         
        * ``fleetProgressHalted`` - The price in every launch specification is not valid. A launch specification might become valid if the Spot price changes. 
         

        

        

      InstanceId -> (string)

        

        The ID of the instance. This information is available only for ``instanceChange`` events.

        

        

      

    EventType -> (string)

      

      The event type.

      

      

    Timestamp -> (timestamp)

LastEvaluatedTime -> (timestamp)

  

  The last date and time for the events, in UTC format (for example, *YYYY* -*MM* -*DD* T*HH* :*MM* :*SS* Z). All records up to this time were retrieved.

   

  If ``nextToken`` indicates that there are more results, this value is not present.

  

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  The token for the next set of results.

  

  

FleetId -> (string)

  

  The ID of the EC Fleet.

  

  

StartTime -> (timestamp)

  

  The start date and time for the events, in UTC format (for example, *YYYY* -*MM* -*DD* T*HH* :*MM* :*SS* Z).
