Options

``--filters`` (list)


  One or more filters.

   

   
  * ``amazon-side-asn`` - The Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the Amazon side of the gateway. 
   
  * ``attachment.state`` - The current state of the attachment between the gateway and the VPC (``attaching`` | ``attached`` | ``detaching`` | ``detached`` ). 
   
  * ``attachment.vpc-id`` - The ID of an attached VPC. 
   
  * ``availability-zone`` - The Availability Zone for the virtual private gateway (if applicable). 
   
  * ``state`` - The state of the virtual private gateway (``pending`` | ``available`` | ``deleting`` | ``deleted`` ). 
   
  * ``tag`` :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA`` , specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value. 
   
  * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value. 
   
  * ``type`` - The type of virtual private gateway. Currently the only supported type is ``ipsec.1`` . 
   
  * ``vpn-gateway-id`` - The ID of the virtual private gateway. 
   

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Name=string,Values=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Name": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--vpn-gateway-ids`` (list)


  One or more virtual private gateway IDs.

   

  Default: Describes all your virtual private gateways.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
