===========
Description
===========



Retrieves the configuration data of the specified instance. You can use this data to create a launch template.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ec2-2016-11-15/GetLaunchTemplateData>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis
========

::

    get-launch-template-data
  [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
  --instance-id <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--instance-id`` (string)


  The ID of the instance.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


========
Examples
========

**To get instance data for a launch template**

This example gets data about the specified instance and uses the ``--query`` option to return the contents in ``LaunchTemplateData``. You can use the output as a base to create a new launch template or launch template version.

Command::

  aws ec2 get-launch-template-data --instance-id i-0123d646e8048babc --query 'LaunchTemplateData'
