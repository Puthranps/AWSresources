*****************************
create-vpc-peering-connection
*****************************



===========
Description
===========



Requests a VPC peering connection between two VPCs: a requester VPC that you own and an accepter VPC with which to create the connection. The accepter VPC can belong to another AWS account and can be in a different Region to the requester VPC. The requester VPC and accepter VPC cannot have overlapping CIDR blocks.

 

.. note::

   

  Limitations and rules apply to a VPC peering connection. For more information, see the `limitations <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/vpc-peering-basics.html#vpc-peering-limitations>`__ section in the *VPC Peering Guide* .

   

 

The owner of the accepter VPC must accept the peering request to activate the peering connection. The VPC peering connection request expires after 7 days, after which it cannot be accepted or rejected.

 

If you create a VPC peering connection request between VPCs with overlapping CIDR blocks, the VPC peering connection has a status of ``failed`` .

=======
Options
=======

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--peer-owner-id`` (string)


  The AWS account ID of the owner of the accepter VPC.

   

  Default: Your AWS account ID

  

``--peer-vpc-id`` (string)


  The ID of the VPC with which you are creating the VPC peering connection. You must specify this parameter in the request.

  

``--vpc-id`` (string)


  The ID of the requester VPC. You must specify this parameter in the request.

  

``--peer-region`` (string)


  The region code for the accepter VPC, if the accepter VPC is located in a region other than the region in which you make the request.

   

  Default: The region in which you make the request.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
