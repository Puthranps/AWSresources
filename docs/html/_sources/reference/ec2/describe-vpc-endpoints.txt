    describe-vpc-endpoints
  [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
  [--vpc-endpoint-ids <value>]
  [--filters <value>]
  [--max-results <value>]
  [--next-token <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--vpc-endpoint-ids`` (list)


  One or more endpoint IDs.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--filters`` (list)


  One or more filters.

   

   
  * ``service-name`` : The name of the service. 
   
  * ``vpc-id`` : The ID of the VPC in which the endpoint resides. 
   
  * ``vpc-endpoint-id`` : The ID of the endpoint. 
   
  * ``vpc-endpoint-state`` : The state of the endpoint. (``pending`` | ``available`` | ``deleting`` | ``deleted`` ) 
   

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Name=string,Values=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Name": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of items to return for this request. The request returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the next set of results.

   

  Constraint: If the value is greater than 1000, we return only 1000 items.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a prior call.)

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
