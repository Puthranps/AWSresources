Options
=======

``--client-token`` (string)


  Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure idempotency of the request. For more information, see `How to Ensure Idempotency <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide* .

  

``--currency-code`` (string)


  The currency in which the ``totalUpfrontPrice`` , ``LimitPrice`` , and ``totalHourlyPrice`` amounts are specified. At this time, the only supported currency is ``USD`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``USD``

  

  

``--host-id-set`` (list)


  The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts with which the reservation will be associated.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--limit-price`` (string)


  The specified limit is checked against the total upfront cost of the reservation (calculated as the offering's upfront cost multiplied by the host count). If the total upfront cost is greater than the specified price limit, the request fails. This is used to ensure that the purchase does not exceed the expected upfront cost of the purchase. At this time, the only supported currency is ``USD`` . For example, to indicate a limit price of USD 100, specify 100.00.

  

``--offering-id`` (string)


  The ID of the offering.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
