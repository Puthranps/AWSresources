===========
Description
===========



Copies a point-in-time snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can copy the snapshot within the same region or from one region to another. You can use the snapshot to create EBS volumes or Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). The snapshot is copied to the regional endpoint that you send the HTTP request to.

 

Copies of encrypted EBS snapshots remain encrypted. Copies of unencrypted snapshots remain unencrypted, unless the ``Encrypted`` flag is specified during the snapshot copy operation. By default, encrypted snapshot copies use the default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK); however, you can specify a non-default CMK with the ``KmsKeyId`` parameter.

 

To copy an encrypted snapshot that has been shared from another account, you must have permissions for the CMK used to encrypt the snapshot.

 

Snapshots created by copying another snapshot have an arbitrary volume ID that should not be used for any purpose.

 

For more information, see `Copying an Amazon EBS Snapshot <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-copy-snapshot.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide* .

=======
Options
=======

``--description`` (string)


  A description for the EBS snapshot.

  

``--destination-region`` (string)


  The destination region to use in the ``PresignedUrl`` parameter of a snapshot copy operation. This parameter is only valid for specifying the destination region in a ``PresignedUrl`` parameter, where it is required.

   

  The snapshot copy is sent to the regional endpoint that you sent the HTTP request to (for example, ``ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`` ). With the AWS CLI, this is specified using the ``--region`` parameter or the default region in your AWS configuration file.

  

``--encrypted`` | ``--no-encrypted`` (boolean)


  Specifies whether the destination snapshot should be encrypted. You can encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot, but you cannot use it to create an unencrypted copy of an encrypted snapshot. Your default CMK for EBS is used unless you specify a non-default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) CMK using ``KmsKeyId`` . For more information, see `Amazon EBS Encryption <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide* .

  

``--kms-key-id`` (string)


  An identifier for the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use when creating the encrypted volume. This parameter is only required if you want to use a non-default CMK; if this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for EBS is used. If a ``KmsKeyId`` is specified, the ``Encrypted`` flag must also be set. 

   

  The CMK identifier may be provided in any of the following formats: 

   

   
  * Key ID 
   
  * Key alias 
   
  * ARN using key ID. The ID ARN contains the ``arn:aws:kms`` namespace, followed by the region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the ``key`` namespace, and then the CMK ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:*us-east-1* :*012345678910* :key/*abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef* .  
   
  * ARN using key alias. The alias ARN contains the ``arn:aws:kms`` namespace, followed by the region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the ``alias`` namespace, and then the CMK alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:*us-east-1* :*012345678910* :alias/*ExampleAlias* .  
   

   

  AWS parses ``KmsKeyId`` asynchronously, meaning that the action you call may appear to complete even though you provided an invalid identifier. The action will eventually fail. 

  

``--presigned-url`` (string)


  When you copy an encrypted source snapshot using the Amazon EC2 Query API, you must supply a pre-signed URL. This parameter is optional for unencrypted snapshots. For more information, see `Query Requests <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html>`__ .

   

  The ``PresignedUrl`` should use the snapshot source endpoint, the ``CopySnapshot`` action, and include the ``SourceRegion`` , ``SourceSnapshotId`` , and ``DestinationRegion`` parameters. The ``PresignedUrl`` must be signed using AWS Signature Version 4. Because EBS snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, the signing algorithm for this parameter uses the same logic that is described in `Authenticating Requests by Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4) <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference* . An invalid or improperly signed ``PresignedUrl`` will cause the copy operation to fail asynchronously, and the snapshot will move to an ``error`` state.

  

``--source-region`` (string)


  The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied.

  

``--source-snapshot-id`` (string)


  The ID of the EBS snapshot to copy.

  

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Examples
========

**To copy a snapshot**

This example command copies a snapshot with the snapshot ID of ``snap-066877671789bd71b`` from the ``us-west-2`` region to the ``us-east-1`` region and adds a short description to identify the snapshot.

Command::

  aws --region us-east-1 ec2 copy-snapshot --source-region us-west-2 --source-snapshot-id snap-066877671789bd71b --description "This is my copied snapshot."

Output::

   {
       "SnapshotId": "snap-066877671789bd71b"
   }

======
Output
======

SnapshotId -> (string)

  

  The ID of the new snapshot.
