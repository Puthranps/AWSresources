=======
Options
=======

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--fpga-image-ids`` (list)


  One or more AFI IDs.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--owners`` (list)


  Filters the AFI by owner. Specify an AWS account ID, ``self`` (owner is the sender of the request), or an AWS owner alias (valid values are ``amazon`` | ``aws-marketplace`` ).

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--filters`` (list)


  One or more filters.

   

   
  * ``create-time`` - The creation time of the AFI. 
   
  * ``fpga-image-id`` - The FPGA image identifier (AFI ID). 
   
  * ``fpga-image-global-id`` - The global FPGA image identifier (AGFI ID). 
   
  * ``name`` - The name of the AFI. 
   
  * ``owner-id`` - The AWS account ID of the AFI owner. 
   
  * ``product-code`` - The product code. 
   
  * ``shell-version`` - The version of the AWS Shell that was used to create the bitstream. 
   
  * ``state`` - The state of the AFI (``pending`` | ``failed`` | ``available`` | ``unavailable`` ). 
   
  * ``tag`` :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA`` , specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value. 
   
  * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value. 
   
  * ``update-time`` - The time of the most recent update. 
   

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Name=string,Values=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Name": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--next-token`` (string)


  The token to retrieve the next page of results.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to return in a single call.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
