===========
Description
===========



Launches the specified number of instances using an AMI for which you have permissions. 

 

You can specify a number of options, or leave the default options. The following rules apply:

 

 
* [EC2-VPC] If you don't specify a subnet ID, we choose a default subnet from your default VPC for you. If you don't have a default VPC, you must specify a subnet ID in the request. 
 
* [EC2-Classic] If don't specify an Availability Zone, we choose one for you. 
 
* Some instance types must be launched into a VPC. If you do not have a default VPC, or if you do not specify a subnet ID, the request fails. For more information, see `Instance Types Available Only in a VPC <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html#vpc-only-instance-types>`__ . 
 
* [EC2-VPC] All instances have a network interface with a primary private IPv4 address. If you don't specify this address, we choose one from the IPv4 range of your subnet. 
 
* Not all instance types support IPv6 addresses. For more information, see `Instance Types <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html>`__ . 
 
* If you don't specify a security group ID, we use the default security group. For more information, see `Security Groups <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html>`__ . 
 
* If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for which the user has not subscribed, the request fails. 
 

 

You can create a `launch template <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html>`__ , which is a resource that contains the parameters to launch an instance. When you launch an instance using  RunInstances , you can specify the launch template instead of specifying the launch parameters.

 

To ensure faster instance launches, break up large requests into smaller batches. For example, create five separate launch requests for 100 instances each instead of one launch request for 500 instances.

 

An instance is ready for you to use when it's in the ``running`` state. You can check the state of your instance using  DescribeInstances . You can tag instances and EBS volumes during launch, after launch, or both. For more information, see  CreateTags and `Tagging Your Amazon EC2 Resources <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html>`__ .

 

Linux instances have access to the public key of the key pair at boot. You can use this key to provide secure access to the instance. Amazon EC2 public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords. For more information, see `Key Pairs <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide* .

 

For troubleshooting, see `What To Do If An Instance Immediately Terminates <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_InstanceStraightToTerminated.html>`__ , and `Troubleshooting Connecting to Your Instance <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide* .

Options
=======

``--block-device-mappings`` (list)


  One or more block device mapping entries. You can't specify both a snapshot ID and an encryption value. This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on creation. If a snapshot is the basis for a volume, it is not blank and its encryption status is used for the volume encryption status.

The following example requests a public IP address for an instance that you're launching into a nondefault subnet:

Command::

  aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-c3b8d6aa --count 1 --instance-type t2.medium --key-name MyKeyPair --security-group-ids sg-903004f8 --subnet-id subnet-6e7f829e --associate-public-ip-address

**To launch an instance using a block device mapping**

Add the following parameter to your ``run-instances`` command to specify block devices::

  --block-device-mappings file://mapping.json

To add an Amazon EBS volume with the device name ``/dev/sdh`` and a volume size of 100, specify the following in mapping.json::

  [
    {
      "DeviceName": "/dev/sdh",
      "Ebs": {
        "VolumeSize": 100
      }
    }
  ]

To add ``ephemeral1`` as an instance store volume with the device name ``/dev/sdc``, specify the following in mapping.json::

  [
    {
      "DeviceName": "/dev/sdc",
      "VirtualName": "ephemeral1"
    }
  ]

To omit a device specified by the AMI used to launch the instance (for example, ``/dev/sdf``), specify the following in mapping.json::

  [
    {
      "DeviceName": "/dev/sdf",
      "NoDevice": ""
    }
  ]

You can view only the Amazon EBS volumes in your block device mapping using the console or the ``describe-instances`` command. To view all volumes, including the instance store volumes, use the following command.

Command::

  curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/block-device-mapping/

Output::

  ami
  ephemeral1

Note that ``ami`` represents the root volume. To get details about the instance store volume ``ephemeral1``, use the following command.

Command::

  curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/block-device-mapping/ephemeral1

Output::

  sdc

**To launch an instance with a modified block device mapping**

You can change individual characteristics of existing AMI block device mappings to suit your needs. Perhaps you want to use an existing AMI, but you want a larger root volume than the usual 8 GiB. Or, you would like to use a General Purpose (SSD) volume for an AMI that currently uses a Magnetic volume.

Use the ``describe-images`` command with the image ID of the AMI you want to use to find its existing block device mapping. You should see a block device mapping in the output::

  {
    "DeviceName": "/dev/sda1",
    "Ebs": {
      "DeleteOnTermination": true,
      "SnapshotId": "snap-1234567890abcdef0",
      "VolumeSize": 8,
      "VolumeType": "standard",
      "Encrypted": false
    }
  }

You can modify the above mapping by changing the individual parameters. For example, to launch an instance with a modified block device mapping, add the following parameter to your ``run-instances`` command to change the above mapping's volume size and type::

  --block-device-mappings file://mapping.json

Where mapping.json contains the following::

  [
    {
      "DeviceName": "/dev/sda1",
      "Ebs": {
        "DeleteOnTermination": true,
        "SnapshotId": "snap-1234567890abcdef0", 
        "VolumeSize": 100,
        "VolumeType": "gp2"
      }
    }
  ]

**To launch an instance with user data**

You can launch an instance and specify user data that performs instance configuration, or that runs a script. The user data needs to be passed as normal string, base64 encoding is handled internally. The following example passes user data in a file called ``my_script.txt`` that contains a configuration script for your instance. The script runs at launch.

Command::

  aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-abc1234 --count 1 --instance-type m4.large --key-name keypair --user-data file://my_script.txt --subnet-id subnet-abcd1234 --security-group-ids sg-abcd1234 

For more information about launching instances, see `Using Amazon EC2 Instances`_ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*.

.. _`Using Amazon EC2 Instances`: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-ec2-launch.html

**To launch an instance with an instance profile**

This example shows the use of the ``iam-instance-profile`` option to specify an `IAM instance profile`_ by name.

.. _`IAM instance profile`: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html

Command::

  aws ec2 run-instances --iam-instance-profile Name=MyInstanceProfile --image-id ami-1a2b3c4d --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name MyKeyPair --security-groups MySecurityGroup

**To launch an instance with tags**

You can launch an instance and specify tags for the instance, volumes, or both. The following example applies a tag with a key of ``webserver`` and value of ``production`` to the instance. The command also applies a tag with a key of ``cost-center`` and a value of ``cc123`` to any EBS volume that's created (in this case, the root volume).

Command::

  aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-abc12345 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name MyKeyPair --subnet-id subnet-6e7f829e --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=webserver,Value=production}]' 'ResourceType=volume,Tags=[{Key=cost-center,Value=cc123}]' 
  
**To launch an instance with the credit option for CPU usage of "unlimited"**
  
You can launch an instance and specify the credit option for CPU usage for the instance. If you do not specify the credit option, the instance launches with the default "standard" credit option. The following example launches a t2.micro instance with the "unlimited" credit option.
  
Command::
  
  aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-abc12345 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name MyKeyPair --credit-specification CpuCredits=unlimited
  
**To launch an instance with a custom number of vCPUs**

This example launches an ``r4.4xlarge`` instance type with six vCPUs (three CPU cores multiplied by two threads per core).

Command::

  aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-1a2b3c4d --instance-type r4.4xlarge --cpu-options "CoreCount=3,ThreadsPerCore=2" --key-name MyKeyPair

**To launch an instance and disable hyperthreading**

This example launchs an ``r4.4xlarge`` instance type and disables hyperthreading by specifying one thread per core and specifying the default number of CPU cores for the instance type (eight).

Command::

  aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-1a2b3c4d --instance-type r4.4xlarge --cpu-options "CoreCount=8,ThreadsPerCore=1" --key-name MyKeyPair
