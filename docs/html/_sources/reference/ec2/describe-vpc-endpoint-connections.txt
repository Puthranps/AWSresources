===========
Description
===========



Describes the VPC endpoint connections to your VPC endpoint services, including any endpoints that are pending your acceptance.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ec2-2016-11-15/DescribeVpcEndpointConnections>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis

    describe-vpc-endpoint-connections
  [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
  [--filters <value>]
  [--max-results <value>]
  [--next-token <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--filters`` (list)


  One or more filters.

   

   
  * ``service-id`` - The ID of the service. 
   
  * ``vpc-endpoint-owner`` - The AWS account number of the owner of the endpoint. 
   
  * ``vpc-endpoint-state`` - The state of the endpoint (``pendingAcceptance`` | ``pending`` | ``available`` | ``deleting`` | ``deleted`` | ``rejected`` | ``failed`` ). 
   
  * ``vpc-endpoint-id`` - The ID of the endpoint. 
   

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Name=string,Values=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Name": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another request with the returned ``NextToken`` value. This value can be between 5 and 1000; if ``MaxResults`` is given a value larger than 1000, only 1000 results are returned.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token to retrieve the next page of results.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


========
Examples
========

**To describe VPC endpoint connections**

This example describes the interface endpoint connections to your endpoint service and filters the results to display endpoints that are ``PendingAcceptance``.

Command::

  aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoint-connections --filters Name=vpc-endpoint-state,Values=pendingAcceptance
  
Output::

  {
    "VpcEndpointConnections": [
        {
            "VpcEndpointId": "vpce-0abed31004e618123", 
            "ServiceId": "vpce-svc-0abced088d20def56", 
            "CreationTimestamp": "2017-11-30T10:00:24.350Z", 
            "VpcEndpointState": "pendingAcceptance", 
            "VpcEndpointOwner": "123456789012"
        }
    ]
  }
