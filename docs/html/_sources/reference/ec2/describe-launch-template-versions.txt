=======
Options
=======

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--launch-template-id`` (string)


  The ID of the launch template. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request.

  

``--launch-template-name`` (string)


  The name of the launch template. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request.

  

``--versions`` (list)


  One or more versions of the launch template.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--min-version`` (string)


  The version number after which to describe launch template versions.

  

``--max-version`` (string)


  The version number up to which to describe launch template versions.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token to request the next page of results.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to return in a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned ``NextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 200.

  

``--filters`` (list)


  One or more filters.

   

   
  * ``create-time`` - The time the launch template version was created. 
   
  * ``ebs-optimized`` - A boolean that indicates whether the instance is optimized for Amazon EBS I/O. 
   
  * ``iam-instance-profile`` - The ARN of the IAM instance profile. 
   
  * ``image-id`` - The ID of the AMI. 
   
  * ``instance-type`` - The instance type. 
   
  * ``is-default-version`` - A boolean that indicates whether the launch template version is the default version. 
   
  * ``kernel-id`` - The kernel ID. 
   
  * ``ram-disk-id`` - The RAM disk ID. 
   

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Name=string,Values=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Name": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
