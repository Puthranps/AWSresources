Description
===========



Describes the specified Spot Instance requests.

 

You can use ``DescribeSpotInstanceRequests`` to find a running Spot Instance by examining the response. If the status of the Spot Instance is ``fulfilled`` , the instance ID appears in the response and contains the identifier of the instance. Alternatively, you can use  DescribeInstances with a filter to look for instances where the instance lifecycle is ``spot`` .

 

Spot Instance requests are deleted four hours after they are canceled and their instances are terminated.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

          VirtualName -> (string)

            

            The virtual device name (``ephemeral`` N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ``ephemeral0`` and ``ephemeral1`` . The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

             

            NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

             

            Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

            Iops -> (integer)

              

              The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the volume supports. For ``io1`` , this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For ``gp2`` , this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting. For more information about General Purpose SSD baseline performance, I/O credits, and bursting, see `Amazon EBS Volume Types <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide* .

               

              Constraint: Range is 100-20000 IOPS for ``io1`` volumes and 100-10000 IOPS for ``gp2`` volumes.

               

              Condition: This parameter is required for requests to create ``io1`` volumes; it is not used in requests to create ``gp2`` , ``st1`` , ``sc1`` , or ``standard`` volumes.

              

              

            SnapshotId -> (string)

              

              The ID of the snapshot.

              

              

            VolumeSize -> (integer)

              

              The size of the volume, in GiB.

               

              Constraints: 1-16384 for General Purpose SSD (``gp2`` ), 4-16384 for Provisioned IOPS SSD (``io1`` ), 500-16384 for Throughput Optimized HDD (``st1`` ), 500-16384 for Cold HDD (``sc1`` ), and 1-1024 for Magnetic (``standard`` ) volumes. If you specify a snapshot, the volume size must be equal to or larger than the snapshot size.

               

              Default: If you're creating the volume from a snapshot and don't specify a volume size, the default is the snapshot size.

              

              

            VolumeType -> (string)

              

              The volume type: ``gp2`` , ``io1`` , ``st1`` , ``sc1`` , or ``standard`` .

               

              Default: ``standard``  

              

              

            Encrypted -> (boolean)

              

              Indicates whether the EBS volume is encrypted. Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. 

               

              If you are creating a volume from a snapshot, you cannot specify an encryption value. This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on creation. If you are creating a snapshot from an existing EBS volume, you cannot specify an encryption value that differs from that of the EBS volume. We recommend that you omit the encryption value from the block device mappings when creating an image from an instance.

              

              

            KmsKeyId -> (string)

              

              Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN) for a user-managed CMK under which the EBS volume is encrypted.

               

              This parameter is only supported on ``BlockDeviceMapping`` objects called by `RunInstances <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html>`__ , `RequestSpotFleet <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotFleet.html>`__ , and `RequestSpotInstances <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotInstances.html>`__ .

              

              

            

          NoDevice -> (string)

            

            Suppresses the specified device included in the block device mapping of the AMI.

            

            

          

        

      EbsOptimized -> (boolean)

        

        Indicates whether the instance is optimized for EBS I/O. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal EBS I/O performance. This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS Optimized instance.

         

        Default: ``false``  

        

        

      IamInstanceProfile -> (structure)

        

        The IAM instance profile.

        

        Arn -> (string)

          

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance profile.

          

          

        Name -> (string)

          

          The name of the instance profile.

          

          

        

      ImageId -> (string)

        

        The ID of the AMI.

          Describes a network interface.

          

          AssociatePublicIpAddress -> (boolean)

            

            Indicates whether to assign a public IPv4 address to an instance you launch in a VPC. The public IP address can only be assigned to a network interface for eth0, and can only be assigned to a new network interface, not an existing one. You cannot specify more than one network interface in the request. If launching into a default subnet, the default value is ``true`` .

            

            

          DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)

            

            If set to ``true`` , the interface is deleted when the instance is terminated. You can specify ``true`` only if creating a new network interface when launching an instance.

            

            

          Description -> (string)

            

            The description of the network interface. Applies only if creating a network interface when launching an instance.
