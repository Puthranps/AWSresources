``--filters`` (list)


  One or more filters.

   

   
  * ``accepter-vpc-info.cidr-block`` - The IPv4 CIDR block of the accepter VPC. 
   
  * ``accepter-vpc-info.owner-id`` - The AWS account ID of the owner of the accepter VPC. 
   
  * ``accepter-vpc-info.vpc-id`` - The ID of the accepter VPC. 
   
  * ``expiration-time`` - The expiration date and time for the VPC peering connection. 
   
  * ``requester-vpc-info.cidr-block`` - The IPv4 CIDR block of the requester's VPC. 
   
  * ``requester-vpc-info.owner-id`` - The AWS account ID of the owner of the requester VPC. 
   
  * ``requester-vpc-info.vpc-id`` - The ID of the requester VPC. 
   
  * ``status-code`` - The status of the VPC peering connection (``pending-acceptance`` | ``failed`` | ``expired`` | ``provisioning`` | ``active`` | ``deleting`` | ``deleted`` | ``rejected`` ). 
   
  * ``status-message`` - A message that provides more information about the status of the VPC peering connection, if applicable. 
   
  * ``tag`` :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA`` , specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value. 
   
  * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value. 
   
  * ``vpc-peering-connection-id`` - The ID of the VPC peering connection.

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--vpc-peering-connection-ids`` (list)


  One or more VPC peering connection IDs.

   

  Default: Describes all your VPC peering connections.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
