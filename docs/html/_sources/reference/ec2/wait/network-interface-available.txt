===========
Description
===========

Wait until JMESPath query NetworkInterfaces[].Status returns available for all elements when polling with ``describe-network-interfaces``. It will poll every 20 seconds until a successful state has been reached. This will exit with a return code of 255 after 10 failed checks.

``network-interface-available`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``NetworkInterfaces``

``--filters`` (list)


  One or more filters.

   

   
  * ``addresses.private-ip-address`` - The private IPv4 addresses associated with the network interface. 
   
  * ``addresses.primary`` - Whether the private IPv4 address is the primary IP address associated with the network interface.  
   
  * ``addresses.association.public-ip`` - The association ID returned when the network interface was associated with the Elastic IP address (IPv4). 
   
  * ``addresses.association.owner-id`` - The owner ID of the addresses associated with the network interface. 
   
  * ``association.association-id`` - The association ID returned when the network interface was associated with an IPv4 address. 
   
  * ``association.allocation-id`` - The allocation ID returned when you allocated the Elastic IP address (IPv4) for your network interface. 
   
  * ``association.ip-owner-id`` - The owner of the Elastic IP address (IPv4) associated with the network interface. 
   
  * ``association.public-ip`` - The address of the Elastic IP address (IPv4) bound to the network interface. 
   
  * ``association.public-dns-name`` - The public DNS name for the network interface (IPv4). 
   
  * ``attachment.attachment-id`` - The ID of the interface attachment. 
   
  * ``attachment.attach.time`` - The time that the network interface was attached to an instance. 
   
  * ``attachment.delete-on-termination`` - Indicates whether the attachment is deleted when an instance is terminated. 
   
  * ``attachment.device-index`` - The device index to which the network interface is attached. 
   
  * ``attachment.instance-id`` - The ID of the instance to which the network interface is attached. 
   
  * ``attachment.instance-owner-id`` - The owner ID of the instance to which the network interface is attached. 
   
  * ``attachment.nat-gateway-id`` - The ID of the NAT gateway to which the network interface is attached. 
   
  * ``attachment.status`` - The status of the attachment (``attaching`` | ``attached`` | ``detaching`` | ``detached`` ). 
   
  * ``availability-zone`` - The Availability Zone of the network interface. 
   
  * ``description`` - The description of the network interface. 
   
  * ``group-id`` - The ID of a security group associated with the network interface. 
   
  * ``group-name`` - The name of a security group associated with the network interface. 
   
  * ``ipv6-addresses.ipv6-address`` - An IPv6 address associated with the network interface. 
   
  * ``mac-address`` - The MAC address of the network interface. 
   
  * ``network-interface-id`` - The ID of the network interface. 
   
  * ``owner-id`` - The AWS account ID of the network interface owner. 
   
  * ``private-ip-address`` - The private IPv4 address or addresses of the network interface. 
   
  * ``private-dns-name`` - The private DNS name of the network interface (IPv4). 
   
  * ``requester-id`` - The ID of the entity that launched the instance on your behalf (for example, AWS Management Console, Auto Scaling, and so on). 
   
  * ``requester-managed`` - Indicates whether the network interface is being managed by an AWS service (for example, AWS Management Console, Auto Scaling, and so on). 
   
  * ``source-desk-check`` - Indicates whether the network interface performs source/destination checking. A value of ``true`` means checking is enabled, and ``false`` means checking is disabled. The value must be ``false`` for the network interface to perform network address translation (NAT) in your VPC.  
   
  * ``status`` - The status of the network interface. If the network interface is not attached to an instance, the status is ``available`` ; if a network interface is attached to an instance the status is ``in-use`` . 
   
  * ``subnet-id`` - The ID of the subnet for the network interface. 
   
  * ``tag`` :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA`` , specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value. 
   
  * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value. 
   
  * ``vpc-id`` - The ID of the VPC for the network interface.

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--network-interface-ids`` (list)


  One or more network interface IDs.

   

  Default: Describes all your network interfaces.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
