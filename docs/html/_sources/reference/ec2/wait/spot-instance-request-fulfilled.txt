Description
===========

Wait until JMESPath query SpotInstanceRequests[].Status.Code returns fulfilled for all elements when polling with ``describe-spot-instance-requests``. It will poll every 15 seconds until a successful state has been reached. This will exit with a return code of 255 after 40 failed checks.

  * ``launch-group`` - The Spot Instance launch group. 
   
  * ``launch.block-device-mapping.delete-on-termination`` - Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. 
   
  * ``launch.block-device-mapping.device-name`` - The device name for the volume in the block device mapping (for example, ``/dev/sdh`` or ``xvdh`` ). 
   
  * ``launch.block-device-mapping.snapshot-id`` - The ID of the snapshot for the EBS volume. 
   
  * ``launch.block-device-mapping.volume-size`` - The size of the EBS volume, in GiB. 
   
  * ``launch.block-device-mapping.volume-type`` - The type of EBS volume: ``gp2`` for General Purpose SSD, ``io1`` for Provisioned IOPS SSD, ``st1`` for Throughput Optimized HDD, ``sc1`` for Cold HDD, or ``standard`` for Magnetic. 
   
  * ``launch.group-id`` - The ID of the security group for the instance.

  * ``launch.kernel-id`` - The kernel ID. 
   
  * ``launch.key-name`` - The name of the key pair the instance launched with. 
   
  * ``launch.monitoring-enabled`` - Whether detailed monitoring is enabled for the Spot Instance. 
   
  * ``launch.ramdisk-id`` - The RAM disk ID. 
   
  * ``launched-availability-zone`` - The Availability Zone in which the request is launched. 
   
  * ``network-interface.addresses.primary`` - Indicates whether the IP address is the primary private IP address. 
   
  * ``network-interface.delete-on-termination`` - Indicates whether the network interface is deleted when the instance is terminated. 
   
  * ``network-interface.description`` - A description of the network interface. 
   
  * ``network-interface.device-index`` - The index of the device for the network interface attachment on the instance.

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--spot-instance-request-ids`` (list)


  One or more Spot Instance request IDs.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
