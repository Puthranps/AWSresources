=======
Options
=======

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--service-ids`` (list)


  The IDs of one or more services.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--filters`` (list)


  One or more filters.

   

   
  * ``service-name`` - The name of the service. 
   
  * ``service-id`` - The ID of the service. 
   
  * ``service-state`` - The state of the service (``Pending`` | ``Available`` | ``Deleting`` | ``Deleted`` | ``Failed`` ).  
   

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Name=string,Values=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Name": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another request with the returned ``NextToken`` value. This value can be between 5 and 1000; if ``MaxResults`` is given a value larger than 1000, only 1000 results are returned.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token to retrieve the next page of results.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
