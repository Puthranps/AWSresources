===========
Description
===========



Creates a virtual private gateway. A virtual private gateway is the endpoint on the VPC side of your VPN connection. You can create a virtual private gateway before creating the VPC itself.

 

For more information about virtual private gateways, see `AWS Managed VPN Connections <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_VPN.html>`__ in the *Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide* .

Synopsis

::

    create-vpn-gateway
  [--availability-zone <value>]

  [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--availability-zone`` (string)


  The Availability Zone for the virtual private gateway.

  

``--type`` (string)


  The type of VPN connection this virtual private gateway supports.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``ipsec.1``

  

  

``--amazon-side-asn`` (long)


  A private Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the Amazon side of a BGP session. If you're using a 16-bit ASN, it must be in the 64512 to 65534 range. If you're using a 32-bit ASN, it must be in the 4200000000 to 4294967294 range.

   

  Default: 64512

  

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples
========

**To create a virtual private gateway**

This example creates a virtual private gateway.

Command::

  aws ec2 create-vpn-gateway --type ipsec.1

Output::

  {
      "VpnGateway": {
          "AmazonSideAsn": 64512,
          "State": "available",
          "Type": "ipsec.1",
          "VpnGatewayId": "vgw-9a4cacf3",
          "VpcAttachments": []
      }
  }

**To create a virtual private gateway with a specific Amazon-side ASN**

This example creates a virtual private gateway and specifies the Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the Amazon side of the BGP session.

Command::

  aws ec2 create-vpn-gateway --type ipsec.1 --amazon-side-asn 65001

Output::

  {
      "VpnGateway": {
          "AmazonSideAsn": 65001,
          "State": "available",
          "Type": "ipsec.1",
          "VpnGatewayId": "vgw-9a4cacf3",
          "VpcAttachments": []
      }
  }
