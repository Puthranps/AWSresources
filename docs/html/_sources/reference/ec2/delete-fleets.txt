===========
Description
===========



Deletes the specified EC2 Fleet.

 

After you delete an EC2 Fleet, it launches no new instances. You must specify whether an EC2 Fleet should also terminate its instances. If you terminate the instances, the EC2 Fleet enters the ``deleted_terminating`` state. Otherwise, the EC2 Fleet enters the ``deleted_running`` state, and the instances continue to run until they are interrupted or you terminate them manually.

``--terminate-instances`` | ``--no-terminate-instances`` (boolean)


  Indicates whether to terminate instances for an EC2 Fleet if it is deleted successfully.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
