``--rule-set-name`` (string)


  The name of the rule set to create. The name must:

   

   
  * This value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-). 
   
  * Start and end with a letter or number. 
   
  * Contain less than 64 characters. 
   

  

``--original-rule-set-name`` (string)


  The name of the rule set to clone.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
