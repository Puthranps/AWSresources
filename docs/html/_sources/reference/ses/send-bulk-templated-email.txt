send-bulk-templated-email
*************************



===========
Description
===========



Composes an email message to multiple destinations. The message body is created using an email template.

 

In order to send email using the ``SendBulkTemplatedEmail`` operation, your call to the API must meet the following requirements:

 

 
* The call must refer to an existing email template. You can create email templates using the  CreateTemplate operation. 
 
* The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain. 
 
* If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see `Verifying Email Addresses and Domains <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html>`__ in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide.*   
 
* The maximum message size is 10 MB. 
 
* Each ``Destination`` parameter must include at least one recipient email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in the format *UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain* ), the entire message will be rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that are valid. 
 
* The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a larger audience, you can divide your recipient list into groups of 50 or fewer, and then call the ``SendBulkTemplatedEmail`` operation several times to send the message to each group. 
 
* The number of destinations you can contact in a single call to the API may be limited by your account's maximum sending rate.

=======
Options
=======

``--source`` (string)


  The email address that is sending the email. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about verifying identities, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html>`__ .

   

  If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also specify the ``SourceArn`` parameter. For more information about sending authorization, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html>`__ .

   

  .. note::

     

    Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in `RFC6531 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531>`__ . For this reason, the *local part* of a source email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain `7-bit ASCII characters <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Local-part>`__ . If the *domain part* of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in `RFC3492 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492.html>`__ . The sender name (also known as the *friendly name* ) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in `RFC 2047 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047>`__ . MIME encoded-word syntax uses the following form: ``=?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=`` .

     

  

``--source-arn`` (string)


  This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to send for the email address specified in the ``Source`` parameter.

   

  For example, if the owner of ``example.com`` (which has ARN ``arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`` ) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to send from ``user@example.com`` , then you would specify the ``SourceArn`` to be ``arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`` , and the ``Source`` to be ``user@example.com`` .

   

  For more information about sending authorization, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html>`__ .

  

``--reply-to-addresses`` (list)


  The reply-to email address(es) for the message. If the recipient replies to the message, each reply-to address will receive the reply.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--return-path`` (string)


  The email address that bounces and complaints will be forwarded to when feedback forwarding is enabled. If the message cannot be delivered to the recipient, then an error message will be returned from the recipient's ISP; this message will then be forwarded to the email address specified by the ``ReturnPath`` parameter. The ``ReturnPath`` parameter is never overwritten. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. 

  

``--return-path-arn`` (string)


  This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to use the email address specified in the ``ReturnPath`` parameter.

   

  For example, if the owner of ``example.com`` (which has ARN ``arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`` ) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to use ``feedback@example.com`` , then you would specify the ``ReturnPathArn`` to be ``arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com`` , and the ``ReturnPath`` to be ``feedback@example.com`` .

   

  For more information about sending authorization, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html>`__ .

  

``--configuration-set-name`` (string)


  The name of the configuration set to use when you send an email using ``SendBulkTemplatedEmail`` .

  

``--default-tags`` (list)


  A list of tags, in the form of name/value pairs, to apply to an email that you send to a destination using ``SendBulkTemplatedEmail`` .

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Name=string,Value=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Name": "string",
      "Value": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--template`` (string)


  The template to use when sending this email.

  

``--template-arn`` (string)


  The ARN of the template to use when sending this email.

  

``--default-template-data`` (string)


  A list of replacement values to apply to the template when replacement data is not specified in a Destination object. These values act as a default or fallback option when no other data is available.

   

  The template data is a JSON object, typically consisting of key-value pairs in which the keys correspond to replacement tags in the email template.

  

``--destinations`` (list)


  One or more ``Destination`` objects. All of the recipients in a ``Destination`` will receive the same version of the email. You can specify up to 50 ``Destination`` objects within a ``Destinations`` array.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Destination={ToAddresses=[string,string],CcAddresses=[string,string],BccAddresses=[string,string]},ReplacementTags=[{Name=string,Value=string},{Name=string,Value=string}],ReplacementTemplateData=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Destination": {
        "ToAddresses": ["string", ...],
        "CcAddresses": ["string", ...],
        "BccAddresses": ["string", ...]
      },
      "ReplacementTags": [
        {
          "Name": "string",
          "Value": "string"
        }
        ...
      ],
      "ReplacementTemplateData": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
