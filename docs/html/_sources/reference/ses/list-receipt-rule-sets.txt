===========
Description
===========



Lists the receipt rule sets that exist under your AWS account in the current AWS Region. If there are additional receipt rule sets to be retrieved, you will receive a ``NextToken`` that you can provide to the next call to ``ListReceiptRuleSets`` to retrieve the additional entries.

 

For information about managing receipt rule sets, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/receiving-email-managing-receipt-rule-sets.html>`__ .

 

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

Options

``--next-token`` (string)


  A token returned from a previous call to ``ListReceiptRuleSets`` to indicate the position in the receipt rule set list.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
