===========
Description
===========



Provides a list of the configuration sets associated with your Amazon SES account in the current AWS Region. For information about using configuration sets, see `Monitoring Your Amazon SES Sending Activity <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitor-sending-activity.html>`__ in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide.*  

 

You can execute this operation no more than once per second. This operation will return up to 1,000 configuration sets each time it is run. If your Amazon SES account has more than 1,000 configuration sets, this operation will also return a NextToken element. You can then execute the ``ListConfigurationSets`` operation again, passing the ``NextToken`` parameter and the value of the NextToken element to retrieve additional results.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

::

    list-configuration-sets
  [--next-token <value>]
  [--max-items <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--next-token`` (string)


  A token returned from a previous call to ``ListConfigurationSets`` to indicate the position of the configuration set in the configuration set list.

  

``--max-items`` (integer)


  The number of configuration sets to return.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
