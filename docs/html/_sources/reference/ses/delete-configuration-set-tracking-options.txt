===========
Description
===========



Deletes an association between a configuration set and a custom domain for open and click event tracking.

 

By default, images and links used for tracking open and click events are hosted on domains operated by Amazon SES. You can configure a subdomain of your own to handle these events. For information about using custom domains, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/configure-custom-open-click-domains.html>`__ .

 

.. note::

   

  Deleting this kind of association will result in emails sent using the specified configuration set to capture open and click events using the standard, Amazon SES-operated domains.

Options
=======

``--configuration-set-name`` (string)


  The name of the configuration set from which you want to delete the tracking options.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
