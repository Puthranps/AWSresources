===========
Description
===========



Deletes a previously created webhook by name. Deleting the webhook stops AWS CodePipeline from starting a pipeline every time an external event occurs. The API will return successfully when trying to delete a webhook that is already deleted. If a deleted webhook is re-created by calling PutWebhook with the same name, it will have a different URL.

Options

``--name`` (string)


  The name of the webhook you want to delete.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
