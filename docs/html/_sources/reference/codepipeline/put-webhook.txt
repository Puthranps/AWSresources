===========
Description
===========



Defines a webhook and returns a unique webhook URL generated by CodePipeline. This URL can be supplied to third party source hosting providers to call every time there's a code change. When CodePipeline receives a POST request on this URL, the pipeline defined in the webhook is started as long as the POST request satisfied the authentication and filtering requirements supplied when defining the webhook. RegisterWebhookWithThirdParty and DeregisterWebhookWithThirdParty APIs can be used to automatically configure supported third parties to call the generated webhook URL.

``--webhook`` (structure)


  The detail provided in an input file to create the webhook, such as the webhook name, the pipeline name, and the action name. Give the webhook a unique name which identifies the webhook being defined. You may choose to name the webhook after the pipeline and action it targets so that you can easily recognize what it's used for later.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    name=string,targetPipeline=string,targetAction=string,filters=[{jsonPath=string,matchEquals=string},{jsonPath=string,matchEquals=string}],authentication=string,authenticationConfiguration={AllowedIPRange=string,SecretToken=string}




JSON Syntax::

    "name": "string",
    "targetPipeline": "string",
    "targetAction": "string",
    "filters": [
      {
        "jsonPath": "string",

  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

webhook -> (structure)

  

  The detail returned from creating the webhook, such as the webhook name, webhook URL, and webhook ARN.

  

  definition -> (structure)

    

    The detail returned for each webhook, such as the webhook authentication type and filter rules.

    

    name -> (string)

      

      The name of the webhook.

      

      

    targetPipeline -> (string)

      

      The name of the pipeline you want to connect to the webhook.

      

      

    targetAction -> (string)

      

      The name of the action in a pipeline you want to connect to the webhook. The action must be from the source (first) stage of the pipeline.

      

      

    filters -> (list)

      

      A list of rules applied to the body/payload sent in the POST request to a webhook URL. All defined rules must pass for the request to be accepted and the pipeline started.

      

      (structure)

        

        The event criteria that specify when a webhook notification is sent to your URL.

        

        jsonPath -> (string)

          

          A JsonPath expression that will be applied to the body/payload of the webhook. The value selected by JsonPath expression must match the value specified in the matchEquals field, otherwise the request will be ignored. More information on JsonPath expressions can be found here: https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath.

          

          

        matchEquals -> (string)

          

          The value selected by the JsonPath expression must match what is supplied in the MatchEquals field, otherwise the request will be ignored. Properties from the target action configuration can be included as placeholders in this value by surrounding the action configuration key with curly braces. For example, if the value supplied here is "refs/heads/{Branch}" and the target action has an action configuration property called "Branch" with a value of "master", the MatchEquals value will be evaluated as "refs/heads/master". A list of action configuration properties for built-in action types can be found here: `Pipeline Structure Reference Action Requirements <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-pipeline-structure.html#action-requirements>`__ .

          

          

        

      

    authentication -> (string)

      

      Supported options are GITHUB_HMAC, IP and UNAUTHENTICATED.

       

       
      * GITHUB_HMAC implements the authentication scheme described here: https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/ 
       
      * IP will reject webhooks trigger requests unless they originate from an IP within the IP range whitelisted in the authentication configuration. 
       
      * UNAUTHENTICATED will accept all webhook trigger requests regardless of origin. 
       

      

      

    authenticationConfiguration -> (structure)

      

      Properties that configure the authentication applied to incoming webhook trigger requests. The required properties depend on the authentication type. For GITHUB_HMAC, only the SecretToken property must be set. For IP, only the AllowedIPRange property must be set to a valid CIDR range. For UNAUTHENTICATED, no properties can be set.

      

      AllowedIPRange -> (string)

        

        

      SecretToken -> (string)

        

        

      

    

  url -> (string)

    

    A unique URL generated by CodePipeline. When a POST request is made to this URL, the defined pipeline is started as long as the body of the post request satisfies the defined authentication and filtering conditions. Deleting and re-creating a webhook will make the old URL invalid and generate a new URL.

    

    

  errorMessage -> (string)

    

    The text of the error message about the webhook.

    

    

  errorCode -> (string)

    

    The number code of the error.

    

    

  lastTriggered -> (timestamp)

    

    The date and time a webhook was last successfully triggered, in timestamp format.

    

    

  arn -> (string)

    

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the webhook.
