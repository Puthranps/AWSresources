===========
Description
===========

Retrieves information about a resource definition version, including which resources are included in the version.

See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/greengrass-2017-06-07/GetResourceDefinitionVersion>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis

::

    get-resource-definition-version
  --resource-definition-id <value>
  --resource-definition-version-id <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--resource-definition-id`` (string)
The ID of the resource definition.

``--resource-definition-version-id`` (string)
The ID of the resource definition version.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

Arn -> (string)

  Arn of the resource definition version.

  

CreationTimestamp -> (string)

  The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the resource definition version was created.

  

Definition -> (structure)

  Information about the definition.

  Resources -> (list)

    A list of resources.

    (structure)

      Information about a resource.

      Id -> (string)

        The resource ID, used to refer to a resource in the Lambda function configuration. Max length is 128 characters with pattern ''[a-zA-Z0-9:_-]+''. This must be unique within a Greengrass group.

        

      Name -> (string)

        The descriptive resource name, which is displayed on the Greengrass console. Max length 128 characters with pattern ''[a-zA-Z0-9:_-]+''. This must be unique within a Greengrass group.

        

      ResourceDataContainer -> (structure)

        A container of data for all resource types.

        LocalDeviceResourceData -> (structure)

          Attributes that define the local device resource.

          GroupOwnerSetting -> (structure)

            Group/owner related settings for local resources.

            AutoAddGroupOwner -> (boolean)

              If true, GreenGrass automatically adds the specified Linux OS group owner of the resource to the Lambda process privileges. Thus the Lambda process will have the file access permissions of the added Linux group.

              

            GroupOwner -> (string)

              The name of the Linux OS group whose privileges will be added to the Lambda process. This field is optional.

              

            

          SourcePath -> (string)

            The local absolute path of the device resource. The source path for a device resource can refer only to a character device or block device under ''/dev''.

            

          

        LocalVolumeResourceData -> (structure)

          Attributes that define the local volume resource.

          DestinationPath -> (string)

            The absolute local path of the resource inside the lambda environment.

            

          GroupOwnerSetting -> (structure)

            Allows you to configure additional group privileges for the Lambda process. This field is optional.

            AutoAddGroupOwner -> (boolean)

              If true, GreenGrass automatically adds the specified Linux OS group owner of the resource to the Lambda process privileges. Thus the Lambda process will have the file access permissions of the added Linux group.

              

            GroupOwner -> (string)

              The name of the Linux OS group whose privileges will be added to the Lambda process. This field is optional.

              

            

          SourcePath -> (string)

            The local absolute path of the volume resource on the host. The source path for a volume resource type cannot start with ''/sys''.

            

          

        S3MachineLearningModelResourceData -> (structure)

          Attributes that define an S3 machine learning resource.

          DestinationPath -> (string)

            The absolute local path of the resource inside the Lambda environment.

            

          S3Uri -> (string)

            The URI of the source model in an S3 bucket. The model package must be in tar.gz or .zip format.
