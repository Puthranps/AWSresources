subscribe

===========
Description
===========



Prepares to subscribe an endpoint by sending the endpoint a confirmation message. To actually create a subscription, the endpoint owner must call the ``ConfirmSubscription`` action with the token from the confirmation message. Confirmation tokens are valid for three days.

 

This action is throttled at 100 transactions per second (TPS).

=======
Options
=======

``--topic-arn`` (string)


  The ARN of the topic you want to subscribe to.

  

``--protocol`` (string)


  The protocol you want to use. Supported protocols include:

   

   
  * ``http`` -- delivery of JSON-encoded message via HTTP POST 
   
  * ``https`` -- delivery of JSON-encoded message via HTTPS POST 
   
  * ``email`` -- delivery of message via SMTP 
   
  * ``email-json`` -- delivery of JSON-encoded message via SMTP 
   
  * ``sms`` -- delivery of message via SMS 
   
  * ``sqs`` -- delivery of JSON-encoded message to an Amazon SQS queue 
   
  * ``application`` -- delivery of JSON-encoded message to an EndpointArn for a mobile app and device. 
   
  * ``lambda`` -- delivery of JSON-encoded message to an AWS Lambda function. 
   

  

``--attributes`` (map)


  Assigns attributes to the subscription as a map of key-value pairs. You can assign any attribute that is supported by the ``SetSubscriptionAttributes`` action.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string




JSON Syntax::

  {"string": "string"
    ...}



``--return-subscription-arn`` | ``--no-return-subscription-arn`` (boolean)


  Sets whether the response from the ``Subscribe`` request includes the subscription ARN, even if the subscription is not yet confirmed.

   

  If you set this parameter to ``false`` , the response includes the ARN for confirmed subscriptions, but it includes an ARN value of "pending subscription" for subscriptions that are not yet confirmed. A subscription becomes confirmed when the subscriber calls the ``ConfirmSubscription`` action with a confirmation token.

   

  If you set this parameter to ``true`` , the response includes the ARN in all cases, even if the subscription is not yet confirmed.

   

  The default value is ``false`` .

  

``--notification-endpoint`` (string)


  The endpoint that you want to receive notifications. Endpoints vary by protocol:

   

   
  * For the ``http`` protocol, the endpoint is an URL beginning with "http://" 
   
  * For the ``https`` protocol, the endpoint is a URL beginning with "https://" 
   
  * For the ``email`` protocol, the endpoint is an email address 
   
  * For the ``email-json`` protocol, the endpoint is an email address 
   
  * For the ``sms`` protocol, the endpoint is a phone number of an SMS-enabled device 
   
  * For the ``sqs`` protocol, the endpoint is the ARN of an Amazon SQS queue 
   
  * For the ``application`` protocol, the endpoint is the EndpointArn of a mobile app and device. 
   
  * For the ``lambda`` protocol, the endpoint is the ARN of an AWS Lambda function. 
   

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


========
Examples
========

The following command subscribes an email address to a topic::

  aws sns subscribe --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:0123456789012:my-topic --protocol email --notification-endpoint my-email@example.com

Output::

  {
      "SubscriptionArn": "pending confirmation"
  }


======
Output
======

SubscriptionArn -> (string)

  

  The ARN of the subscription if it is confirmed, or the string "pending confirmation" if the subscription requires confirmation. However, if the API request parameter ``ReturnSubscriptionArn`` is true, then the value is always the subscription ARN, even if the subscription requires confirmation.
