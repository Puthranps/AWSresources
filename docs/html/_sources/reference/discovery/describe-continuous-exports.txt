``--export-ids`` (list)


  The unique IDs assigned to the exports.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--max-results`` (integer)


  A number between 1 and 100 specifying the maximum number of continuous export descriptions returned.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token from the previous call to ``DescribeExportTasks`` .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
