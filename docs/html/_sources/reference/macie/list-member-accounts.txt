=======
Options
=======

``--next-token`` (string)


  Use this parameter when paginating results. Set the value of this parameter to null on your first call to the ListMemberAccounts action. Subsequent calls to the action fill nextToken in the request with the value of nextToken from the previous response to continue listing data. 

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Use this parameter to indicate the maximum number of items that you want in the response. The default value is 250. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
