**********************



===========
Description
===========



Lists all signing platforms available in AWS Signer that match the request parameters. If additional jobs remain to be listed, AWS Signer returns a ``nextToken`` value. Use this value in subsequent calls to ``ListSigningJobs`` to fetch the remaining values. You can continue calling ``ListSigningJobs`` with your ``maxResults`` parameter and with new values that AWS Signer returns in the ``nextToken`` parameter until all of your signing jobs have been returned.

    list-signing-platforms
  [--category <value>]
  [--partner <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--category`` (string)


  The category type of a signing platform.

  

``--partner`` (string)


  Any partner entities connected to a signing platform.

  

``--target`` (string)


  The validation template that is used by the target signing platform.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to be returned by this operation.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  Value for specifying the next set of paginated results to return. After you receive a response with truncated results, use this parameter in a subsequent request. Set it to the value of ``nextToken`` from the response that you just received.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
