*****************
start-signing-job
*****************



===========
Description
===========



Initiates a signing job to be performed on the code provided. Signing jobs are viewable by the ``ListSigningJobs`` operation for two years after they are performed. Note the following requirements: 

 

 
* You must create an Amazon S3 source bucket. For more information, see `Create a Bucket <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 Getting Started Guide* .  
 
* Your S3 source bucket must be version enabled. 
 
* You must create an S3 destination bucket. AWS Signer uses your S3 destination bucket to write your signed code. 
 
* You specify the name of the source and destination buckets when calling the ``StartSigningJob`` operation. 
 
* You must also specify a request token that identifies your request to AWS Signer.  
 

 

You can call the  DescribeSigningJob and the  ListSigningJobs actions after you call ``StartSigningJob`` .

 

For a Java example that shows how to use this action, see `http\://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/>`__

=======
Options
=======

``--source`` (structure)


  The S3 bucket that contains the object to sign or a BLOB that contains your raw code.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    s3={bucketName=string,key=string,version=string}




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "s3": {
      "bucketName": "string",
      "key": "string",
      "version": "string"
    }
  }



``--destination`` (structure)


  The S3 bucket in which to save your signed object. The destination contains the name of your bucket and an optional prefix.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    s3={bucketName=string,prefix=string}




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "s3": {
      "bucketName": "string",
      "prefix": "string"
    }
  }



``--profile-name`` (string)


  The name of the signing profile.

  

``--client-request-token`` (string)


  String that identifies the signing request. All calls after the first that use this token return the same response as the first call.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
