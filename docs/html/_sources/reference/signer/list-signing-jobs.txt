*****************

===========
Description
===========



Lists all your signing jobs. You can use the ``maxResults`` parameter to limit the number of signing jobs that are returned in the response. If additional jobs remain to be listed, AWS Signer returns a ``nextToken`` value. Use this value in subsequent calls to ``ListSigningJobs`` to fetch the remaining values. You can continue calling ``ListSigningJobs`` with your ``maxResults`` parameter and with new values that AWS Signer returns in the ``nextToken`` parameter until all of your signing jobs have been returned.

=======
Options
=======

``--status`` (string)


  A status value with which to filter your results.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``InProgress``

  
  *   ``Failed``

  
  *   ``Succeeded``

  

  

``--platform-id`` (string)


  The ID of microcontroller platform that you specified for the distribution of your code image.

  

``--requested-by`` (string)


  The IAM principal that requested the signing job.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Specifies the maximum number of items to return in the response. Use this parameter when paginating results. If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the ``nextToken`` element is set in the response. Use the ``nextToken`` value in a subsequent request to retrieve additional items. 

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  String for specifying the next set of paginated results to return. After you receive a response with truncated results, use this parameter in a subsequent request. Set it to the value of ``nextToken`` from the response that you just received.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
