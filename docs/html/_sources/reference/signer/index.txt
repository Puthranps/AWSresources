You can use Code Signing for Amazon FreeRTOS (AWS Signer) to sign code that you created for any of the IoT devices that Amazon Web Services supports. AWS Signer is integrated with Amazon FreeRTOS, AWS Certificate Manager, and AWS CloudTrail. Amazon FreeRTOS customers can use AWS Signer to sign code images before making them available for microcontrollers. You can use ACM to import third-party certificates to be used by AWS Signer. For general information about using AWS Signer, see the `Code Signing for Amazon FreeRTOS Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html>`__ .
