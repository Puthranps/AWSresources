Synopsis

::

    get-resource-policy
  --secret-id <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options

``--secret-id`` (string)


  Specifies the secret that you want to retrieve the attached resource-based policy for. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.

   

  .. note::

     

    If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names that end with a hyphen followed by six characters.

     

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Examples
========

**To retrieve the resource-based policy attached to a secret**

The following example shows how to retrieve the resource-based policy that is attached to a secret.  For more information, see `Resource-based Policies` in the *Secrets Manager User Guide*.
.. _`Resource-based Policies`: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_overview.html#auth-and-access_resource-policies :: 

  aws secretsmanager get-resource-policy --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret

The output shows the following. It is shown here word-wrapped and with extra white-space removed for clarity. ::

  {
      "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3",
      "Name": "MyTestDatabaseSecret",
      "ResourcePolicy": "{\n\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\n\"Statement\":[{\n\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\n
                         \"Principal\":{\n\"AWS\":\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root\"\n},\n\"Action\":
                         \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\",\n\"Resource\":\"*\"\n}]\n}"
  }

Output
======

ARN -> (string)

  

  The ARN of the secret that the resource-based policy was retrieved for.

  

  

Name -> (string)

  

  The friendly name of the secret that the resource-based policy was retrieved for.

  

  

ResourcePolicy -> (string)

  

  A JSON-formatted string that describes the permissions that are associated with the attached secret. These permissions are combined with any permissions that are associated with the user or role that attempts to access this secret. The combined permissions specify who can access the secret and what actions they can perform.
