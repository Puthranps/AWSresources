===========
Description
===========



Lists all of the secrets that are stored by Secrets Manager in the AWS account. To list the versions currently stored for a specific secret, use  ListSecretVersionIds . The encrypted fields ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` are not included in the output. To get that information, call the  GetSecretValue operation.

 

.. note::

   

  Always check the ``NextToken`` response parameter when calling any of the ``List*`` operations. These operations can occasionally return an empty or shorter than expected list of results even when there are more results available. When this happens, the ``NextToken`` response parameter contains a value to pass to the next call to the same API to request the next part of the list.

   

 

 **Minimum permissions**  

 

To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

 

 
* secretsmanager:ListSecrets 
 

 

 **Related operations**  

 

 
* To list the versions attached to a secret, use  ListSecretVersionIds .

Synopsis

::

    list-secrets
  [--max-results <value>]
  [--next-token <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--max-results`` (integer)


  (Optional) Limits the number of results that you want to include in the response. If you don't include this parameter, it defaults to a value that's specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``NextToken`` response element is present and has a value (isn't null). Include that value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Secrets Manager might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  (Optional) Use this parameter in a request if you receive a ``NextToken`` response in a previous request that indicates that there's more output available. In a subsequent call, set it to the value of the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to indicate where the output should continue from.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples

**To list the secrets in your account**

The following example shows how to list all of the secrets in your account. ::

	aws secretsmanager list-secrets 

The output shows the following: ::

	{
	  "SecretList": [
	    {
	      "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3",
	      "Name": "MyTestDatabaseSecret",
	      "Description": "My test database secret",
	      "LastChangedDate": 1523477145.729,

======
Output
======

SecretList -> (list)

  

  A list of the secrets in the account.

  

  (structure)

    

    A structure that contains the details about a secret. It does not include the encrypted ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` values. To get those values, use the  GetSecretValue operation.

    

    ARN -> (string)

      

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.

       

      For more information about ARNs in Secrets Manager, see `Policy Resources <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_iam-permissions.html#iam-resources>`__ in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide* .

      

      

    Name -> (string)

      

      The friendly name of the secret. You can use forward slashes in the name to represent a path hierarchy. For example, ``/prod/databases/dbserver1`` could represent the secret for a server named ``dbserver1`` in the folder ``databases`` in the folder ``prod`` . 

      

      

    Description -> (string)

      

      The user-provided description of the secret.

      

      

    KmsKeyId -> (string)

      

      The ARN or alias of the AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) that's used to encrypt the ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` fields in each version of the secret. If you don't provide a key, then Secrets Manager defaults to encrypting the secret fields with the default KMS CMK (the one named ``awssecretsmanager`` ) for this account.

      

      

    RotationEnabled -> (boolean)

      

      Indicated whether automatic, scheduled rotation is enabled for this secret.

      

      

    RotationLambdaARN -> (string)

      

      The ARN of an AWS Lambda function that's invoked by Secrets Manager to rotate and expire the secret either automatically per the schedule or manually by a call to  RotateSecret .

      

      

    RotationRules -> (structure)

      

      A structure that defines the rotation configuration for the secret.

      

      AutomaticallyAfterDays -> (long)

        

        Specifies the number of days between automatic scheduled rotations of the secret.

         

        Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one is complete. Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that 24-hour date window randomly. The minute is also chosen somewhat randomly, but weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced by a variety of factors that help distribute load.

        

        

      

    LastRotatedDate -> (timestamp)

      

      The last date and time that the rotation process for this secret was invoked.

      

      

    LastChangedDate -> (timestamp)

      

      The last date and time that this secret was modified in any way.

      

      

    LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)

      

      The last date that this secret was accessed. This value is truncated to midnight of the date and therefore shows only the date, not the time.

      

      

    DeletedDate -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time on which this secret was deleted. Not present on active secrets. The secret can be recovered until the number of days in the recovery window has passed, as specified in the ``RecoveryWindowInDays`` parameter of the  DeleteSecret operation.

      

      

    Tags -> (list)

      

      The list of user-defined tags that are associated with the secret. To add tags to a secret, use  TagResource . To remove tags, use  UntagResource .

      

      (structure)

        

        A structure that contains information about a tag.

        

        Key -> (string)

          

          The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

          

          

        Value -> (string)

          

          The string value that's associated with the key of the tag.

          

          

        

      

    SecretVersionsToStages -> (map)

      

      A list of all of the currently assigned ``SecretVersionStage`` staging labels and the ``SecretVersionId`` that each is attached to. Staging labels are used to keep track of the different versions during the rotation process.

       

      .. note::

         

        A version that does not have any ``SecretVersionStage`` is considered deprecated and subject to deletion. Such versions are not included in this list.

         

      

      key -> (string)

        

        

      value -> (list)

        

        (string)

          

          

        

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  If present in the response, this value indicates that there's more output available than what's included in the current response. This can occur even when the response includes no values at all, such as when you ask for a filtered view of a very long list. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to continue processing and get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back empty (as ``null`` ).
