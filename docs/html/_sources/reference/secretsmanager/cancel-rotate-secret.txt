********************
cancel-rotate-secret
********************



===========
Description
===========



Disables automatic scheduled rotation and cancels the rotation of a secret if one is currently in progress.

 

To re-enable scheduled rotation, call  RotateSecret with ``AutomaticallyRotateAfterDays`` set to a value greater than 0. This will immediately rotate your secret and then enable the automatic schedule.

 

.. note::

   

  If you cancel a rotation that is in progress, it can leave the ``VersionStage`` labels in an unexpected state. Depending on what step of the rotation was in progress, you might need to remove the staging label ``AWSPENDING`` from the partially created version, specified by the ``VersionId`` response value. You should also evaluate the partially rotated new version to see if it should be deleted, which you can do by removing all staging labels from the new version's ``VersionStage`` field.

   

 

To successfully start a rotation, the staging label ``AWSPENDING`` must be in one of the following states:

 

 
* Not be attached to any version at all 
 
* Attached to the same version as the staging label ``AWSCURRENT``   
 

 

If the staging label ``AWSPENDING`` is attached to a different version than the version with ``AWSCURRENT`` then the attempt to rotate fails.

 

 **Minimum permissions**  

 

To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

 

 
* secretsmanager:CancelRotateSecret 
 

 

 **Related operations**  

 

 
* To configure rotation for a secret or to manually trigger a rotation, use  RotateSecret . 
 
* To get the rotation configuration details for a secret, use  DescribeSecret . 
 
* To list all of the currently available secrets, use  ListSecrets . 
 
* To list all of the versions currently associated with a secret, use  ListSecretVersionIds .

Synopsis

::

    cancel-rotate-secret
  --secret-id <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--secret-id`` (string)


  Specifies the secret for which you want to cancel a rotation request. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.

   

  .. note::

     

    If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names that end with a hyphen followed by six characters.

     

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


========
Examples
========

**To cancel scheduled rotation for a secret**

The following example shows how to cancel rotation for a secret. The operation sets the ``RotationEnabled`` field to false and cancels all scheduled rotations. To resume scheduled rotations, you must re-enable rotation by calling the ``rotate-secret`` operation. ::

	aws secretsmanager cancel-rotate-secret --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret

The output shows the following: ::

	{
	  "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3",
	  "Name": "MyTestDatabaseSecret"
	}



======
Output
======

ARN -> (string)

  

  The ARN of the secret for which rotation was canceled.

  

  

Name -> (string)

  

  The friendly name of the secret for which rotation was canceled.

  

  

VersionId -> (string)

  

  The unique identifier of the version of the secret that was created during the rotation. This version might not be complete, and should be evaluated for possible deletion. At the very least, you should remove the ``VersionStage`` value ``AWSPENDING`` to enable this version to be deleted. Failing to clean up a cancelled rotation can block you from successfully starting future rotations.
