===========
Description
===========



Removes one or more tags from the specified secret.

 

This operation is idempotent. If a requested tag is not attached to the secret, no error is returned and the secret metadata is unchanged.

 

.. warning::

   

  If you use tags as part of your security strategy, then removing a tag can change permissions. If successfully completing this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then the operation is blocked and returns an Access Denied error.

   

 

 **Minimum permissions**  

 

To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

 

 
* secretsmanager:UntagResource 
 

 

 **Related operations**  

 

 
* To add one or more tags to the collection attached to a secret, use  TagResource . 
 
* To view the list of tags attached to a secret, use  DescribeSecret .

Options

``--secret-id`` (string)


  The identifier for the secret that you want to remove tags from. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.

   

  .. note::

     

    If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names that end with a hyphen followed by six characters.

     

  

``--tag-keys`` (list)


  A list of tag key names to remove from the secret. You don't specify the value. Both the key and its associated value are removed.

   

  This parameter to the API requires a JSON text string argument. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see `Using JSON for Parameters <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json>`__ in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples
========

**To remove tags from a secret**

The following example shows how to remove two tags from a secret's metadata. For each tag, both the key and its associated value are removed. ::

	aws secretsmanager untag-resource --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret \
	  --tag-keys '[ "FirstTag", "SecondTag"]'

There is no output from this API. To see the result, use the describe-secret operation.
