===========
Description
===========



Generates a random password of the specified complexity. This operation is intended for use in the Lambda rotation function. Per best practice, we recommend that you specify the maximum length and include every character type that the system you are generating a password for can support.

 

 **Minimum permissions**  

 

To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

=======
Options
=======

``--password-length`` (long)


  The desired length of the generated password. The default value if you do not include this parameter is 32 characters.

  

``--exclude-characters`` (string)


  A string that includes characters that should not be included in the generated password. The default is that all characters from the included sets can be used.

  

``--exclude-numbers`` | ``--no-exclude-numbers`` (boolean)


  Specifies that the generated password should not include digits. The default if you do not include this switch parameter is that digits can be included.

  

``--exclude-punctuation`` | ``--no-exclude-punctuation`` (boolean)


  Specifies that the generated password should not include punctuation characters. The default if you do not include this switch parameter is that punctuation characters can be included.

   

  The following are the punctuation characters that *can* be included in the generated password if you don't explicitly exclude them with ``ExcludeCharacters`` or ``ExcludePunctuation`` :

   

   ``! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~``  

  

``--exclude-uppercase`` | ``--no-exclude-uppercase`` (boolean)


  Specifies that the generated password should not include uppercase letters. The default if you do not include this switch parameter is that uppercase letters can be included.

  

``--exclude-lowercase`` | ``--no-exclude-lowercase`` (boolean)


  Specifies that the generated password should not include lowercase letters. The default if you do not include this switch parameter is that lowercase letters can be included.

  

``--include-space`` | ``--no-include-space`` (boolean)


  Specifies that the generated password can include the space character. The default if you do not include this switch parameter is that the space character is not included.

  

``--require-each-included-type`` | ``--no-require-each-included-type`` (boolean)


  A boolean value that specifies whether the generated password must include at least one of every allowed character type. The default value is ``True`` and the operation requires at least one of every character type.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Examples
========

**To generate a random password**

The following example shows how to request a randomly generated password. This example includes the optional flags to require spaces and at least one character of each included type. It specifies a length of 20 characters. ::

	aws secretsmanager get-random-password --include-space --password-length 20 --require-each-included-type 

The output shows the following: ::

	{
	  "RandomPassword": "N+Z43a,>vx7j O8^*<8i3"
	}
