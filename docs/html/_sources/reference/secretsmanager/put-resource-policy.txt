*******************
put-resource-policy
*******************



===========
Description
===========



Attaches the contents of the specified resource-based permission policy to a secret. A resource-based policy is optional. Alternatively, you can use IAM identity-based policies that specify the secret's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the policy statement's ``Resources`` element. You can also use a combination of both identity-based and resource-based policies. The affected users and roles receive the permissions that are permitted by all of the relevant policies. For more information, see `Using Resource-Based Policies for AWS Secrets Manager <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_resource-based-policies.html>`__ . For the complete description of the AWS policy syntax and grammar, see `IAM JSON Policy Reference <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

 

 **Minimum permissions**  

 

To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

 

 
* secretsmanager:PutResourcePolicy 
 

 

 **Related operations**  

 

 
* To retrieve the resource policy that's attached to a secret, use  GetResourcePolicy . 
 
* To delete the resource-based policy that's attached to a secret, use  DeleteResourcePolicy . 
 
* To list all of the currently available secrets, use  ListSecrets .

Synopsis

::

    put-resource-policy
  --secret-id <value>
  --resource-policy <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--secret-id`` (string)


  Specifies the secret that you want to attach the resource-based policy to. You can specify either the ARN or the friendly name of the secret.

   

  .. note::

     

    If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names that end with a hyphen followed by six characters.

     

  

``--resource-policy`` (string)


  A JSON-formatted string that's constructed according to the grammar and syntax for an AWS resource-based policy. The policy in the string identifies who can access or manage this secret and its versions. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see `Using JSON for Parameters <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json>`__ in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples
========

**To add a resource-based policy to a secret**

The following example shows how to add a resource-based policy to a secret. The policy is read from a file on disk and must contain a valid JSON policy document. For more information, see `Resource-based Policies` in the *Secrets Manager User Guide*.
.. _`Resource-based Policies`: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_overview.html#auth-and-access_resource-policies::

  aws secretsmanager put-resource-policy --secret-id MyTestDatabaseMasterSecret \
      --resource-policy file://mysecretpolicy.json 

The output shows the following: ::

  {
      "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3",
      "Name": "MyTestDatabaseSecret"
  }


======
Output
======

ARN -> (string)

  

  The ARN of the secret that the resource-based policy was retrieved for.

  

  

Name -> (string)

  

  The friendly name of the secret that the resource-based policy was retrieved for.
