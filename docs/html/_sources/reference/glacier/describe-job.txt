===========
Description
===========



This operation returns information about a job you previously initiated, including the job initiation date, the user who initiated the job, the job status code/message and the Amazon SNS topic to notify after Amazon Glacier completes the job. For more information about initiating a job, see  InitiateJob . 

 

.. note::

   

  This operation enables you to check the status of your job. However, it is strongly recommended that you set up an Amazon SNS topic and specify it in your initiate job request so that Amazon Glacier can notify the topic after it completes the job.

   

 

A job ID will not expire for at least 24 hours after Amazon Glacier completes the job.

 

An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see `Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html>`__ .

 

For more information about using this operation, see the documentation for the underlying REST API `Describe Job <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-describe-job-get.html>`__ in the *Amazon Glacier Developer Guide* .

Synopsis
========

::

    describe-job
  --account-id <value>
  --vault-name <value>
  --job-id <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--account-id`` (string)


  The ``AccountId`` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '``-`` ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID. 

  

``--vault-name`` (string)


  The name of the vault.

  

``--job-id`` (string)


  The ID of the job to describe.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


========
Examples
========

The following command retrieves information about an inventory retrieval job on a vault named ``my-vault``::

  aws glacier describe-job --account-id - --vault-name my-vault --job-id zbxcm3Z_3z5UkoroF7SuZKrxgGoDc3RloGduS7Eg-RO47Yc6FxsdGBgf_Q2DK5Ejh18CnTS5XW4_XqlNHS61dsO4CnMW

Output::

  {
      "InventoryRetrievalParameters": {
          "Format": "JSON"
      },
      "VaultARN": "arn:aws:glacier:us-west-2:0123456789012:vaults/my-vault",
      "Completed": false,
      "JobId": "zbxcm3Z_3z5UkoroF7SuZKrxgGoDc3RloGduS7Eg-RO47Yc6FxsdGBgf_Q2DK5Ejh18CnTS5XW4_XqlNHS61dsO4CnMW",
      "Action": "InventoryRetrieval",
      "CreationDate": "2015-07-17T20:23:41.616Z",
      "StatusCode": "InProgress"
  }

The job ID can be found in the output of ``aws glacier initiate-job`` and ``aws glacier list-jobs``.
Amazon Glacier requires an account ID argument when performing operations, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.
