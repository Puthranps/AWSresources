===========
Description
===========



Remove cost allocation tags from the specified Amazon SQS queue. For an overview, see `Tagging Your Amazon SQS Queues <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-tags.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* .

 

When you use queue tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:

 

 
* Adding more than 50 tags to a queue isn't recommended. 
 
* Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SQS interprets tags as character strings. 
 
* Tags are case-sensitive. 
 
* A new tag with a key identical to that of an existing tag overwrites the existing tag. 
 
* Tagging actions are limited to 5 TPS per AWS account. If your application requires a higher throughput, file a `technical support request <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=technical>`__ . 
 

 

For a full list of tag restrictions, see `Limits Related to Queues <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-limits.html#limits-queues>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* .

 

.. note::

   

  Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
