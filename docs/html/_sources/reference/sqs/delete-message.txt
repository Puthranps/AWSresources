.. _cli:aws sqs delete-message:


**************
delete-message
**************



===========
Description
===========



Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. To select the message to delete, use the ``ReceiptHandle`` of the message (*not* the ``MessageId`` which you receive when you send the message). Amazon SQS can delete a message from a queue even if a visibility timeout setting causes the message to be locked by another consumer. Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages left in a queue longer than the retention period configured for the queue. 

 

.. note::

   

  The ``ReceiptHandle`` is associated with a *specific instance* of receiving a message. If you receive a message more than once, the ``ReceiptHandle`` is different each time you receive a message. When you use the ``DeleteMessage`` action, you must provide the most recently received ``ReceiptHandle`` for the message (otherwise, the request succeeds, but the message might not be deleted).

   

  For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message. The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a subsequent receive request. You should ensure that your application is idempotent, so that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.

Synopsis

    delete-message
  --queue-url <value>
  --receipt-handle <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--queue-url`` (string)


  The URL of the Amazon SQS queue from which messages are deleted.

   

  Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

  

``--receipt-handle`` (string)


  The receipt handle associated with the message to delete.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
