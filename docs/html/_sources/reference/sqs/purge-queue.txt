===========
Description
===========



Deletes the messages in a queue specified by the ``QueueURL`` parameter.

 

.. warning::

   

  When you use the ``PurgeQueue`` action, you can't retrieve any messages deleted from a queue.

   

  The message deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. We recommend waiting for 60 seconds regardless of your queue's size. 

   

 

Messages sent to the queue *before* you call ``PurgeQueue`` might be received but are deleted within the next minute.

 

Messages sent to the queue *after* you call ``PurgeQueue`` might be deleted while the queue is being purged.

    purge-queue

Options

``--queue-url`` (string)


  The URL of the queue from which the ``PurgeQueue`` action deletes messages.

   

  Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
