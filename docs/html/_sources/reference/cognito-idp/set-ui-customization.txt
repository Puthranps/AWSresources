********************
set-ui-customization
********************



===========
Description
===========



Sets the UI customization information for a user pool's built-in app UI.

 

You can specify app UI customization settings for a single client (with a specific ``clientId`` ) or for all clients (by setting the ``clientId`` to ``ALL`` ). If you specify ``ALL`` , the default configuration will be used for every client that has no UI customization set previously. If you specify UI customization settings for a particular client, it will no longer fall back to the ``ALL`` configuration. 

 

.. note::

   

  To use this API, your user pool must have a domain associated with it. Otherwise, there is no place to host the app's pages, and the service will throw an error.

  The user pool ID for the user pool.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
