=======
Options
=======

``--user-pool-id`` (string)


  The ID of the Amazon Cognito user pool.

  

``--client-id`` (string)


  The app client ID.

  

``--auth-flow`` (string)


  The authentication flow for this call to execute. The API action will depend on this value. For example:

   

   
  * ``REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH`` will take in a valid refresh token and return new tokens. 
   
  * ``USER_SRP_AUTH`` will take in ``USERNAME`` and ``SRP_A`` and return the SRP variables to be used for next challenge execution. 
   
  * ``USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`` will take in ``USERNAME`` and ``PASSWORD`` and return the next challenge or tokens. 
   

   

  Valid values include:

   

   
  * ``USER_SRP_AUTH`` : Authentication flow for the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol. 
   
  * ``REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH`` /``REFRESH_TOKEN`` : Authentication flow for refreshing the access token and ID token by supplying a valid refresh token. 
   
  * ``CUSTOM_AUTH`` : Custom authentication flow. 
   
  * ``ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH`` : Non-SRP authentication flow; you can pass in the USERNAME and PASSWORD directly if the flow is enabled for calling the app client. 
   
  * ``USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`` : Non-SRP authentication flow; USERNAME and PASSWORD are passed directly. If a user migration Lambda trigger is set, this flow will invoke the user migration Lambda if the USERNAME is not found in the user pool.  
   

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``USER_SRP_AUTH``

  
  *   ``REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH``

  
  *   ``REFRESH_TOKEN``

  
  *   ``CUSTOM_AUTH``

  
  *   ``ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH``

  
  *   ``USER_PASSWORD_AUTH``

  

  

``--auth-parameters`` (map)


  The authentication parameters. These are inputs corresponding to the ``AuthFlow`` that you are invoking. The required values depend on the value of ``AuthFlow`` :

   

   
  * For ``USER_SRP_AUTH`` : ``USERNAME`` (required), ``SRP_A`` (required), ``SECRET_HASH`` (required if the app client is configured with a client secret), ``DEVICE_KEY``   
   
  * For ``REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH/REFRESH_TOKEN`` : ``REFRESH_TOKEN`` (required), ``SECRET_HASH`` (required if the app client is configured with a client secret), ``DEVICE_KEY``   
   
  * For ``ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH`` : ``USERNAME`` (required), ``SECRET_HASH`` (if app client is configured with client secret), ``PASSWORD`` (required), ``DEVICE_KEY``   
   
  * For ``CUSTOM_AUTH`` : ``USERNAME`` (required), ``SECRET_HASH`` (if app client is configured with client secret), ``DEVICE_KEY``   
   

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string




JSON Syntax::

  {"string": "string"
    ...}



``--client-metadata`` (map)


  This is a random key-value pair map which can contain any key and will be passed to your PreAuthentication Lambda trigger as-is. It can be used to implement additional validations around authentication.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string




JSON Syntax::

  {"string": "string"
    ...}



``--analytics-metadata`` (structure)


  The analytics metadata for collecting Amazon Pinpoint metrics for ``AdminInitiateAuth`` calls.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    AnalyticsEndpointId=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "AnalyticsEndpointId": "string"
  }



``--context-data`` (structure)


  Contextual data such as the user's device fingerprint, IP address, or location used for evaluating the risk of an unexpected event by Amazon Cognito advanced security.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    IpAddress=string,ServerName=string,ServerPath=string,HttpHeaders=[{headerName=string,headerValue=string},{headerName=string,headerValue=string}],EncodedData=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "IpAddress": "string",
    "ServerName": "string",
    "ServerPath": "string",
    "HttpHeaders": [
      {
        "headerName": "string",
        "headerValue": "string"
      }
      ...
    ],
    "EncodedData": "string"
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

ChallengeName -> (string)

  

  The name of the challenge which you are responding to with this call. This is returned to you in the ``AdminInitiateAuth`` response if you need to pass another challenge.

   

   
  * ``MFA_SETUP`` : If MFA is required, users who do not have at least one of the MFA methods set up are presented with an ``MFA_SETUP`` challenge. The user must set up at least one MFA type to continue to authenticate. 
   
  * ``SELECT_MFA_TYPE`` : Selects the MFA type. Valid MFA options are ``SMS_MFA`` for text SMS MFA, and ``SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA`` for TOTP software token MFA. 
   
  * ``SMS_MFA`` : Next challenge is to supply an ``SMS_MFA_CODE`` , delivered via SMS. 
   
  * ``PASSWORD_VERIFIER`` : Next challenge is to supply ``PASSWORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE`` , ``PASSWORD_CLAIM_SECRET_BLOCK`` , and ``TIMESTAMP`` after the client-side SRP calculations. 
   
  * ``CUSTOM_CHALLENGE`` : This is returned if your custom authentication flow determines that the user should pass another challenge before tokens are issued. 
   
  * ``DEVICE_SRP_AUTH`` : If device tracking was enabled on your user pool and the previous challenges were passed, this challenge is returned so that Amazon Cognito can start tracking this device. 
   
  * ``DEVICE_PASSWORD_VERIFIER`` : Similar to ``PASSWORD_VERIFIER`` , but for devices only. 
   
  * ``ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH`` : This is returned if you need to authenticate with ``USERNAME`` and ``PASSWORD`` directly. An app client must be enabled to use this flow. 
   
  * ``NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED`` : For users which are required to change their passwords after successful first login. This challenge should be passed with ``NEW_PASSWORD`` and any other required attributes. 
   

  

  

Session -> (string)

  

  The session which should be passed both ways in challenge-response calls to the service. If ``AdminInitiateAuth`` or ``AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`` API call determines that the caller needs to go through another challenge, they return a session with other challenge parameters. This session should be passed as it is to the next ``AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`` API call.

  

  

ChallengeParameters -> (map)

  

  The challenge parameters. These are returned to you in the ``AdminInitiateAuth`` response if you need to pass another challenge. The responses in this parameter should be used to compute inputs to the next call (``AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`` ).

   

  All challenges require ``USERNAME`` and ``SECRET_HASH`` (if applicable).

   

  The value of the ``USER_ID_FOR_SRP`` attribute will be the user's actual username, not an alias (such as email address or phone number), even if you specified an alias in your call to ``AdminInitiateAuth`` . This is because, in the ``AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`` API ``ChallengeResponses`` , the ``USERNAME`` attribute cannot be an alias.

  

  key -> (string)

    

    

  value -> (string)

    

    

  

AuthenticationResult -> (structure)

  

  The result of the authentication response. This is only returned if the caller does not need to pass another challenge. If the caller does need to pass another challenge before it gets tokens, ``ChallengeName`` , ``ChallengeParameters`` , and ``Session`` are returned.

  

  AccessToken -> (string)

    

    The access token.

    

    

  ExpiresIn -> (integer)

    

    The expiration period of the authentication result in seconds.

    

    

  TokenType -> (string)

    

    The token type.

    

    

  RefreshToken -> (string)

    

    The refresh token.

    

    

  IdToken -> (string)

    

    The ID token.

    

    

  NewDeviceMetadata -> (structure)

    

    The new device metadata from an authentication result.

    

    DeviceKey -> (string)

      

      The device key.

      

      

    DeviceGroupKey -> (string)

      

      The device group key.
