*******************************
admin-disable-provider-for-user
*******************************



===========
Description
===========



Disables the user from signing in with the specified external (SAML or social) identity provider. If the user to disable is a Cognito User Pools native username + password user, they are not permitted to use their password to sign-in. If the user to disable is a linked external IdP user, any link between that user and an existing user is removed. The next time the external user (no longer attached to the previously linked ``DestinationUser`` ) signs in, they must create a new user account. See .

 

This action is enabled only for admin access and requires developer credentials.

 

The ``ProviderName`` must match the value specified when creating an IdP for the pool. 

 

To disable a native username + password user, the ``ProviderName`` value must be ``Cognito`` and the ``ProviderAttributeName`` must be ``Cognito_Subject`` , with the ``ProviderAttributeValue`` being the name that is used in the user pool for the user.

 

The ``ProviderAttributeName`` must always be ``Cognito_Subject`` for social identity providers. The ``ProviderAttributeValue`` must always be the exact subject that was used when the user was originally linked as a source user.

 

For de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the linked identity has not yet been used to sign-in, the ``ProviderAttributeName`` and ``ProviderAttributeValue`` must be the same values that were used for the ``SourceUser`` when the identities were originally linked in the call. (If the linking was done with ``ProviderAttributeName`` set to ``Cognito_Subject`` , the same applies here). However, if the user has already signed in, the ``ProviderAttributeName`` must be ``Cognito_Subject`` and ``ProviderAttributeValue`` must be the subject of the SAML assertion.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
