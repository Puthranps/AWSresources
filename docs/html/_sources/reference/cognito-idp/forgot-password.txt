Description
===========



Calling this API causes a message to be sent to the end user with a confirmation code that is required to change the user's password. For the ``Username`` parameter, you can use the username or user alias. If a verified phone number exists for the user, the confirmation code is sent to the phone number. Otherwise, if a verified email exists, the confirmation code is sent to the email. If neither a verified phone number nor a verified email exists, ``InvalidParameterException`` is thrown. To use the confirmation code for resetting the password, call .

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
