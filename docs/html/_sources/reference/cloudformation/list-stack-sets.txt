Options
=======

``--next-token`` (string)


  If the previous paginated request didn't return all of the remaining results, the response object's ``NextToken`` parameter value is set to a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call ``ListStackSets`` again and assign that token to the request object's ``NextToken`` parameter. If there are no remaining results, the previous response object's ``NextToken`` parameter is set to ``null`` .

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a ``NextToken`` value that you can assign to the ``NextToken`` request parameter to get the next set of results.

  

``--status`` (string)


  The status of the stack sets that you want to get summary information about.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``ACTIVE``

  
  *   ``DELETED``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
