Description
===========



Returns the stack instance that's associated with the specified stack set, AWS account, and region.

 

For a list of stack instances that are associated with a specific stack set, use  ListStackInstances .



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudformation-2010-05-15/DescribeStackInstance>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

=======
Options
=======

``--stack-set-name`` (string)


  The name or the unique stack ID of the stack set that you want to get stack instance information for.

  

``--stack-instance-account`` (string)


  The ID of an AWS account that's associated with this stack instance.

  

``--stack-instance-region`` (string)


  The name of a region that's associated with this stack instance.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

StackInstance -> (structure)

  

  The stack instance that matches the specified request parameters.

  

  StackSetId -> (string)

    

    The name or unique ID of the stack set that the stack instance is associated with.

    

    

  Region -> (string)

    

    The name of the AWS region that the stack instance is associated with.

    

    

  Account -> (string)

    

    The name of the AWS account that the stack instance is associated with.

    

    

  StackId -> (string)

    

    The ID of the stack instance.

    

    

  ParameterOverrides -> (list)

    

    A list of parameters from the stack set template whose values have been overridden in this stack instance.

    

    (structure)

      

      The Parameter data type.

      

      ParameterKey -> (string)

        

        The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, AWS CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.

        

        

      ParameterValue -> (string)

        

        The input value associated with the parameter.

        

        

      UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)

        

        During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

        

        

      ResolvedValue -> (string)

        

        Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for ` ``SSM`` parameter types <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types>`__ in the template.

        

        

      

    

  Status -> (string)

    

    The status of the stack instance, in terms of its synchronization with its associated stack set.

     

     
    * ``INOPERABLE`` : A ``DeleteStackInstances`` operation has failed and left the stack in an unstable state. Stacks in this state are excluded from further ``UpdateStackSet`` operations. You might need to perform a ``DeleteStackInstances`` operation, with ``RetainStacks`` set to ``true`` , to delete the stack instance, and then delete the stack manually. 
     
    * ``OUTDATED`` : The stack isn't currently up to date with the stack set because: 

       
      * The associated stack failed during a ``CreateStackSet`` or ``UpdateStackSet`` operation.  
       
      * The stack was part of a ``CreateStackSet`` or ``UpdateStackSet`` operation that failed or was stopped before the stack was created or updated.  
       

     
     
    * ``CURRENT`` : The stack is currently up to date with the stack set. 
     

    

    

  StatusReason -> (string)

    

    The explanation for the specific status code that is assigned to this stack instance.
