Description
===========



Returns the description for the specified stack; if no stack name was specified, then it returns the description for all the stacks created.

 

.. note::

   

  If the stack does not exist, an ``AmazonCloudFormationException`` is returned.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``describe-stacks`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Stacks``

    describe-stacks
  [--stack-name <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--starting-token <value>]
  [--max-items <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--stack-name`` (string)


  The name or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack, which are not always interchangeable:

   

   
  * Running stacks: You can specify either the stack's name or its unique stack ID. 
   
  * Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID. 
   

   

  Default: There is no default value.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

      (structure)

        

        The Parameter data type.

        

        ParameterKey -> (string)

          

          The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, AWS CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.

          

          

        ParameterValue -> (string)

          

          The input value associated with the parameter.

          

          

        UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)

          

          During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true`` , do not specify a parameter value.

          

          

        ResolvedValue -> (string)

          

          Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for ` ``SSM`` parameter types <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types>`__ in the template.

          

          

        

      

    CreationTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The time at which the stack was created.

      

      

    DeletionTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The time the stack was deleted.

      

      

    LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The time the stack was last updated. This field will only be returned if the stack has been updated at least once.

      

      

    RollbackConfiguration -> (structure)

      

      The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

      

      RollbackTriggers -> (list)

        

        The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions. 

         

        By default, AWS CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

         

         
        * To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter. 
         
        * To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify *all* the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack. 
         
        * To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter. 
         

         

        If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

        

        (structure)

          

          A rollback trigger AWS CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation. 

          

          Arn -> (string)

            

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

             

            If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back. 

            

            

          Type -> (string)

            

            The resource type of the rollback trigger. Currently, `AWS\:\:CloudWatch\:\:Alarm <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cw-alarm.html>`__ is the only supported resource type.

            

            

          

        

      MonitoringTimeInMinutes -> (integer)

        

        The amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

         

        The default is 0 minutes.

         

        If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using `CancelUpdateStack <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html>`__ , for example) as necessary.

         

        If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.

        

        

      

    StackStatus -> (string)

      

      Current status of the stack.

      

      

    StackStatusReason -> (string)

      

      Success/failure message associated with the stack status.

      

      

    DisableRollback -> (boolean)

      

      Boolean to enable or disable rollback on stack creation failures:

       

       
      * ``true`` : disable rollback 
       
      * ``false`` : enable rollback 
       

      

      

    NotificationARNs -> (list)

      

      SNS topic ARNs to which stack related events are published.

      

      (string)

        

        

      

    TimeoutInMinutes -> (integer)

      

      The amount of time within which stack creation should complete.

      

      

    Capabilities -> (list)

      

      The capabilities allowed in the stack.

      

      (string)

        

        

      

    Outputs -> (list)

      

      A list of output structures.

      

      (structure)

        

        The Output data type.

        

        OutputKey -> (string)

          

          The key associated with the output.

          

          

        OutputValue -> (string)

          

          The value associated with the output.

          

          

        Description -> (string)

          

          User defined description associated with the output.

          

          

        ExportName -> (string)

          

          The name of the export associated with the output.

          

          

        

      

    RoleARN -> (string)

      

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that is associated with the stack. During a stack operation, AWS CloudFormation uses this role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.

      

      

    Tags -> (list)

      

      A list of ``Tag`` s that specify information about the stack.

      

      (structure)

        

        The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an AWS CloudFormation stack.

        

        Key -> (string)

          

           *Required* . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (AWS) have the reserved prefix: ``aws:`` .

          

          

        Value -> (string)

          

           *Required* . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

          

          

        

      

    EnableTerminationProtection -> (boolean)

      

      Whether termination protection is enabled for the stack.

       

      For `nested stacks <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html>`__ , termination protection is set on the root stack and cannot be changed directly on the nested stack. For more information, see `Protecting a Stack From Being Deleted <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* .

      

      

    ParentId -> (string)

      

      For nested stacks--stacks created as resources for another stack--the stack ID of the direct parent of this stack. For the first level of nested stacks, the root stack is also the parent stack.

       

      For more information, see `Working with Nested Stacks <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* .

      

      

    RootId -> (string)

      

      For nested stacks--stacks created as resources for another stack--the stack ID of the the top-level stack to which the nested stack ultimately belongs.

       

      For more information, see `Working with Nested Stacks <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide* .

      

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)
