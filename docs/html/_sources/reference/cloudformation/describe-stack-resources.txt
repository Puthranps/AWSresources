===========
Description
===========



Returns AWS resource descriptions for running and deleted stacks. If ``StackName`` is specified, all the associated resources that are part of the stack are returned. If ``PhysicalResourceId`` is specified, the associated resources of the stack that the resource belongs to are returned.

 

.. note::

   

  Only the first 100 resources will be returned. If your stack has more resources than this, you should use ``ListStackResources`` instead.

   

 

For deleted stacks, ``DescribeStackResources`` returns resource information for up to 90 days after the stack has been deleted.

 

You must specify either ``StackName`` or ``PhysicalResourceId`` , but not both. In addition, you can specify ``LogicalResourceId`` to filter the returned result. For more information about resources, the ``LogicalResourceId`` and ``PhysicalResourceId`` , go to the `AWS CloudFormation User Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/>`__ .

 

.. note::

   

  A ``ValidationError`` is returned if you specify both ``StackName`` and ``PhysicalResourceId`` in the same request.

Options

``--stack-name`` (string)


  The name or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack, which are not always interchangeable:

   

   
  * Running stacks: You can specify either the stack's name or its unique stack ID. 
   
  * Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID. 
   

   

  Default: There is no default value.

   

  Required: Conditional. If you do not specify ``StackName`` , you must specify ``PhysicalResourceId`` .

  

``--logical-resource-id`` (string)


  The logical name of the resource as specified in the template.

   

  Default: There is no default value.

  

``--physical-resource-id`` (string)


  The name or unique identifier that corresponds to a physical instance ID of a resource supported by AWS CloudFormation.

   

  For example, for an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, ``PhysicalResourceId`` corresponds to the ``InstanceId`` . You can pass the EC2 ``InstanceId`` to ``DescribeStackResources`` to find which stack the instance belongs to and what other resources are part of the stack.

   

  Required: Conditional. If you do not specify ``PhysicalResourceId`` , you must specify ``StackName`` .

   

  Default: There is no default value.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
