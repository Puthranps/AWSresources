***************************
update-event-source-mapping
***************************



===========
Description
===========



You can update an event source mapping. This is useful if you want to change the parameters of the existing mapping without losing your position in the stream. You can change which function will receive the stream records, but to change the stream itself, you must create a new mapping.

 

If you disable the event source mapping, AWS Lambda stops polling. If you enable again, it will resume polling from the time it had stopped polling, so you don't lose processing of any records. However, if you delete event source mapping and create it again, it will reset.

 

This operation requires permission for the ``lambda:UpdateEventSourceMapping`` action.

=======
Options
=======

``--uuid`` (string)


  The event source mapping identifier.

  

``--function-name`` (string)


  The name of the lambda function.

   

   **Name formats**  

   

   
  * **Function name** - ``MyFunction`` . 
   
  * **Function ARN** - ``arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:MyFunction`` . 
   
  * **Version or Alias ARN** - ``arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:MyFunction:PROD`` . 
   
  * **Partial ARN** - ``123456789012:function:MyFunction`` . 
   

   

  The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify only the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.

  

``--enabled`` | ``--no-enabled`` (boolean)


  Specifies whether AWS Lambda should actively poll the stream or not. If disabled, AWS Lambda will not poll the stream.

  

``--batch-size`` (integer)


  The largest number of records that AWS Lambda will retrieve from your event source at the time of invoking your function. Your function receives an event with all the retrieved records.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

UUID -> (string)

  

  The AWS Lambda assigned opaque identifier for the mapping.

  

  

BatchSize -> (integer)

  

  The largest number of records that AWS Lambda will retrieve from your event source at the time of invoking your function. Your function receives an event with all the retrieved records.

  

  

EventSourceArn -> (string)

  

  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Kinesis or DynamoDB stream that is the source of events.

  

  

FunctionArn -> (string)

  

  The Lambda function to invoke when AWS Lambda detects an event on the poll-based source.

  

  

LastModified -> (timestamp)

  

  The UTC time string indicating the last time the event mapping was updated.

  

  

LastProcessingResult -> (string)

  

  The result of the last AWS Lambda invocation of your Lambda function. This value will be null if an SQS queue is the event source.

  

  

State -> (string)

  

  The state of the event source mapping. It can be ``Creating`` , ``Enabled`` , ``Disabled`` , ``Enabling`` , ``Disabling`` , ``Updating`` , or ``Deleting`` .

  

  

StateTransitionReason -> (string)

  

  The reason the event source mapping is in its current state. It is either user-requested or an AWS Lambda-initiated state transition.
