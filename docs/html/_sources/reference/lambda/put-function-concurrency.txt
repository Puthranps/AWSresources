.. _cli:aws lambda put-function-concurrency:


************************
put-function-concurrency
************************



===========
Description
===========



Sets a limit on the number of concurrent executions available to this function. It is a subset of your account's total concurrent execution limit per region. Note that Lambda automatically reserves a buffer of 100 concurrent executions for functions without any reserved concurrency limit. This means if your account limit is 1000, you have a total of 900 available to allocate to individual functions. For more information, see `Managing Concurrency <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concurrent-executions.html>`__ .

Synopsis

::

    put-function-concurrency
  --function-name <value>
  --reserved-concurrent-executions <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--function-name`` (string)


  The name of the lambda function.

   

   **Name formats**  

   

   
  * **Function name** - ``MyFunction`` . 
   
  * **Function ARN** - ``arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:MyFunction`` . 
   
  * **Partial ARN** - ``123456789012:function:MyFunction`` . 
   

   

  The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify only the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.

  

``--reserved-concurrent-executions`` (integer)


  The concurrent execution limit reserved for this function.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
