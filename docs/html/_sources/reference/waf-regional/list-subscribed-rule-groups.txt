Options
=======

``--next-marker`` (string)


  If you specify a value for ``Limit`` and you have more ``ByteMatchSets`` subscribed rule groups than the value of ``Limit`` , AWS WAF returns a ``NextMarker`` value in the response that allows you to list another group of subscribed rule groups. For the second and subsequent ``ListSubscribedRuleGroupsRequest`` requests, specify the value of ``NextMarker`` from the previous response to get information about another batch of subscribed rule groups.

  

``--limit`` (integer)


  Specifies the number of subscribed rule groups that you want AWS WAF to return for this request. If you have more objects than the number you specify for ``Limit`` , the response includes a ``NextMarker`` value that you can use to get another batch of objects.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
