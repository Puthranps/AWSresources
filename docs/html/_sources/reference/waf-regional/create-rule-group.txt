* Three rule groups per account. You can request an increase to this limit by contacting customer support. 
 
* One rule group per web ACL. 
 
* Ten rules per rule group.

Options

``--name`` (string)


  A friendly name or description of the  RuleGroup . You can't change ``Name`` after you create a ``RuleGroup`` .

  

``--metric-name`` (string)


  A friendly name or description for the metrics for this ``RuleGroup`` . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9); the name can't contain whitespace. You can't change the name of the metric after you create the ``RuleGroup`` .

  

``--change-token`` (string)


  The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
