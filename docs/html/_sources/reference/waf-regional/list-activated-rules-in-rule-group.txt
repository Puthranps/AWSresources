=======
Options
=======

``--rule-group-id`` (string)


  The ``RuleGroupId`` of the  RuleGroup for which you want to get a list of  ActivatedRule objects.

  

``--next-marker`` (string)


  If you specify a value for ``Limit`` and you have more ``ActivatedRules`` than the value of ``Limit`` , AWS WAF returns a ``NextMarker`` value in the response that allows you to list another group of ``ActivatedRules`` . For the second and subsequent ``ListActivatedRulesInRuleGroup`` requests, specify the value of ``NextMarker`` from the previous response to get information about another batch of ``ActivatedRules`` .

  

``--limit`` (integer)


  Specifies the number of ``ActivatedRules`` that you want AWS WAF to return for this request. If you have more ``ActivatedRules`` than the number that you specify for ``Limit`` , the response includes a ``NextMarker`` value that you can use to get another batch of ``ActivatedRules`` .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

NextMarker -> (string)

  

  If you have more ``ActivatedRules`` than the number that you specified for ``Limit`` in the request, the response includes a ``NextMarker`` value. To list more ``ActivatedRules`` , submit another ``ListActivatedRulesInRuleGroup`` request, and specify the ``NextMarker`` value from the response in the ``NextMarker`` value in the next request.

  

  

ActivatedRules -> (list)

  

  An array of ``ActivatedRules`` objects.

  

  (structure)

    

    The ``ActivatedRule`` object in an  UpdateWebACL request specifies a ``Rule`` that you want to insert or delete, the priority of the ``Rule`` in the ``WebACL`` , and the action that you want AWS WAF to take when a web request matches the ``Rule`` (``ALLOW`` , ``BLOCK`` , or ``COUNT`` ).

     

    To specify whether to insert or delete a ``Rule`` , use the ``Action`` parameter in the  WebACLUpdate data type.

    

    Priority -> (integer)

      

      Specifies the order in which the ``Rules`` in a ``WebACL`` are evaluated. Rules with a lower value for ``Priority`` are evaluated before ``Rules`` with a higher value. The value must be a unique integer. If you add multiple ``Rules`` to a ``WebACL`` , the values don't need to be consecutive.

      

      

    RuleId -> (string)

      

      The ``RuleId`` for a ``Rule`` . You use ``RuleId`` to get more information about a ``Rule`` (see  GetRule ), update a ``Rule`` (see  UpdateRule ), insert a ``Rule`` into a ``WebACL`` or delete a one from a ``WebACL`` (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a ``Rule`` from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRule ).

       

       ``RuleId`` is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

      

      

    Action -> (structure)

      

      Specifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the conditions in the ``Rule`` . Valid values for ``Action`` include the following:

       

       
      * ``ALLOW`` : CloudFront responds with the requested object. 
       
      * ``BLOCK`` : CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code. 
       
      * ``COUNT`` : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the conditions in the rule and then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL.  
       

       

       ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` applies only when updating or adding a ``RuleGroup`` to a ``WebACL`` . In this case you do not use ``ActivatedRule|Action`` . For all other update requests, ``ActivatedRule|Action`` is used instead of ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` .

      

      Type -> (string)

        

        Specifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a ``Rule`` . Valid settings include the following:

         

         
        * ``ALLOW`` : AWS WAF allows requests 
         
        * ``BLOCK`` : AWS WAF blocks requests 
         
        * ``COUNT`` : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL. You can't specify ``COUNT`` for the default action for a ``WebACL`` . 
         

        

        

      

    OverrideAction -> (structure)

      

      Use the ``OverrideAction`` to test your ``RuleGroup`` .

       

      Any rule in a ``RuleGroup`` can potentially block a request. If you set the ``OverrideAction`` to ``None`` , the ``RuleGroup`` will block a request if any individual rule in the ``RuleGroup`` matches the request and is configured to block that request. However if you first want to test the ``RuleGroup`` , set the ``OverrideAction`` to ``Count`` . The ``RuleGroup`` will then override any block action specified by individual rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using  GetSampledRequests . 

       

       ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` applies only when updating or adding a ``RuleGroup`` to a ``WebACL`` . In this case you do not use ``ActivatedRule|Action`` . For all other update requests, ``ActivatedRule|Action`` is used instead of ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` .

      

      Type -> (string)

        

         ``COUNT`` overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a ``RuleGroup`` . If set to ``NONE`` , the rule's action will take place.

        

        

      

    Type -> (string)

      

      The rule type, either ``REGULAR`` , as defined by  Rule , ``RATE_BASED`` , as defined by  RateBasedRule , or ``GROUP`` , as defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.
