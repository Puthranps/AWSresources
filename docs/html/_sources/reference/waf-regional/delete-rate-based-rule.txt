**********************
delete-rate-based-rule
**********************



===========
Description
===========



Permanently deletes a  RateBasedRule . You can't delete a rule if it's still used in any ``WebACL`` objects or if it still includes any predicates, such as ``ByteMatchSet`` objects.

 

If you just want to remove a rule from a ``WebACL`` , use  UpdateWebACL .

 

To permanently delete a ``RateBasedRule`` from AWS WAF, perform the following steps:

 

 
* Update the ``RateBasedRule`` to remove predicates, if any. For more information, see  UpdateRateBasedRule . 
 
* Use  GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ``ChangeToken`` parameter of a ``DeleteRateBasedRule`` request. 
 
* Submit a ``DeleteRateBasedRule`` request.

=======
Options
=======

``--rule-id`` (string)


  The ``RuleId`` of the  RateBasedRule that you want to delete. ``RuleId`` is returned by  CreateRateBasedRule and by  ListRateBasedRules .

  

``--change-token`` (string)


  The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Output

ChangeToken -> (string)

  

  The ``ChangeToken`` that you used to submit the ``DeleteRateBasedRule`` request. You can also use this value to query the status of the request. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
