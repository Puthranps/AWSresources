=======
Options
=======

``--detector-id`` (string)
The ID of the detector that specifies the GuardDuty service whose findings you want to retrieve.

``--finding-ids`` (list)
IDs of the findings that you want to retrieve.



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--sort-criteria`` (structure)
Represents the criteria used for sorting findings.



Shorthand Syntax::

    AttributeName=string,OrderBy=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "AttributeName": "string",
    "OrderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
