===========
Description
===========



Gets the current health status (``Healthy`` , ``Unhealthy`` , or ``Unknown`` ) of one or more instances that are associated with a specified service.

 

.. note::

   

  There is a brief delay between when you register an instance and when the health status for the instance is available.

=======
Options
=======

``--service-id`` (string)


  The ID of the service that the instance is associated with.

  

``--instances`` (list)


  An array that contains the IDs of all the instances that you want to get the health status for.

   

  If you omit ``Instances`` , Amazon Route 53 returns the health status for all the instances that are associated with the specified service.

   

  .. note::

     

    To get the IDs for the instances that you've registered by using a specified service, submit a  ListInstances request.

     

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of instances that you want Route 53 to return in the response to a ``GetInstancesHealthStatus`` request. If you don't specify a value for ``MaxResults`` , Route 53 returns up to 100 instances.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  For the first ``GetInstancesHealthStatus`` request, omit this value.

   

  If more than ``MaxResults`` instances match the specified criteria, you can submit another ``GetInstancesHealthStatus`` request to get the next group of results. Specify the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response in the next request.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
