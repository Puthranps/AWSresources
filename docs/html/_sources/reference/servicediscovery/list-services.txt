Description
===========



Lists summary information for all the services that are associated with one or more specified namespaces.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``list-services`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Services``

``--filters`` (list)


  A complex type that contains specifications for the namespaces that you want to list services for. 

   

  If you specify more than one filter, an operation must match all filters to be returned by ``ListServices`` .

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Name=string,Values=string,string,Condition=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Name": "NAMESPACE_ID",
      "Values": ["string", ...],
      "Condition": "EQ"|"IN"|"BETWEEN"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

Services -> (list)

  

  An array that contains one ``ServiceSummary`` object for each service that matches the specified filter criteria.

  

  (structure)

    

    A complex type that contains information about a specified service.

    

    Id -> (string)

      

      The ID that Route 53 assigned to the service when you created it.

      

      

    Arn -> (string)

      

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that Route 53 assigns to the service when you create it.

      

      

    Name -> (string)

      

      The name of the service.

      

      

    Description -> (string)

      

      The description that you specify when you create the service.

      

      

    InstanceCount -> (integer)

      

      The number of instances that are currently associated with the service. Instances that were previously associated with the service but that have been deleted are not included in the count.

      

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  If the response contains ``NextToken`` , submit another ``ListServices`` request to get the next group of results. Specify the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response in the next request.

   

  .. note::

     

    Route 53 gets ``MaxResults`` services and then filters them based on the specified criteria. It's possible that no services in the first ``MaxResults`` services matched the specified criteria but that subsequent groups of ``MaxResults`` services do contain services that match the criteria.
