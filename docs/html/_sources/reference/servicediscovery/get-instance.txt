Synopsis

    get-instance
  --service-id <value>
  --instance-id <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--service-id`` (string)


  The ID of the service that the instance is associated with.

  

``--instance-id`` (string)


  The ID of the instance that you want to get information about.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

Instance -> (structure)

  

  A complex type that contains information about a specified instance.

  

  Id -> (string)

    

    An identifier that you want to associate with the instance. Note the following:

     

     
    * If the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an SRV record, the value of ``InstanceId`` is automatically included as part of the value for the SRV record. For more information, see  DnsRecord$Type . 
     
    * You can use this value to update an existing instance. 
     
    * To register a new instance, you must specify a value that is unique among instances that you register by using the same service.  
     
    * If you specify an existing ``InstanceId`` and ``ServiceId`` , Route 53 updates the existing records. If there's also an existing health check, Route 53 deletes the old health check and creates a new one.  

    .. note::

       The health check isn't deleted immediately, so it will still appear for a while if you submit a ``ListHealthChecks`` request, for example. 

     
     

    

    

  CreatorRequestId -> (string)

    

    A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed ``RegisterInstance`` requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. You must use a unique ``CreatorRequestId`` string every time you submit a ``RegisterInstance`` request if you're registering additional instances for the same namespace and service. ``CreatorRequestId`` can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.

    

    

  Attributes -> (map)

    

    A string map that contains the following information for the service that you specify in ``ServiceId`` :

     

     
    * The attributes that apply to the records that are defined in the service.  
     
    * For each attribute, the applicable value. 
     

     

    Supported attribute keys include the following:

     

     **AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME**  

     

      

     

    If you want Route 53 to create an alias record that routes traffic to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. For information about how to get the DNS name, see "DNSName" in the topic `AliasTarget <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/http:/docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_AliasTarget.html>`__ .

     

    Note the following:

     

     
    * The configuration for the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` must include settings for an A record, an AAAA record, or both. 
     
    * In the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` , the value of ``RoutingPolicy`` must be ``WEIGHTED`` . 
     
    * If the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` includes ``HealthCheckConfig`` settings, Route 53 will create the health check, but it won't associate the health check with the alias record. 
     
    * Auto naming currently doesn't support creating alias records that route traffic to AWS resources other than ELB load balancers. 
     
    * If you specify a value for ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` , don't specify values for any of the ``AWS_INSTANCE`` attributes. 
     

     

     **AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME**  

     

    If the service configuration includes a CNAME record, the domain name that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, ``example.com`` .

     

    This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an CNAME record.

     

     **AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4**  

     

    If the service configuration includes an A record, the IPv4 address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, ``192.0.2.44`` .

     

    This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an A record. If the service includes settings for an SRV record, you must specify a value for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both.

     

     **AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6**  

     

    If the service configuration includes an AAAA record, the IPv6 address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` .

     

    This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an AAAA record. If the service includes settings for an SRV record, you must specify a value for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both.

     

     **AWS_INSTANCE_PORT**  

     

    If the service includes an SRV record, the value that you want Route 53 to return for the port.

     

    If the service includes ``HealthCheckConfig`` , the port on the endpoint that you want Route 53 to send requests to. 

     

    This value is required if you specified settings for an SRV record when you created the service.
