===========
Description
===========



Lists operations that match the criteria that you specify.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``list-operations`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Operations``

``--filters`` (list)


  A complex type that contains specifications for the operations that you want to list, for example, operations that you started between a specified start date and end date.

   

  If you specify more than one filter, an operation must match all filters to be returned by ``ListOperations`` .

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Name=string,Values=string,string,Condition=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Name": "NAMESPACE_ID"|"SERVICE_ID"|"STATUS"|"TYPE"|"UPDATE_DATE",
      "Values": ["string", ...],
      "Condition": "EQ"|"IN"|"BETWEEN"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

Operations -> (list)

  

  Summary information about the operations that match the specified criteria.

  

  (structure)

    

    A complex type that contains information about an operation that matches the criteria that you specified in a  ListOperations request.

    

    Id -> (string)

      

      The ID for an operation.

      

      

    Status -> (string)

      

      The status of the operation. Values include the following:

       

       
      * **SUBMITTED** : This is the initial state immediately after you submit a request. 
       
      * **PENDING** : Route 53 is performing the operation. 
       
      * **SUCCESS** : The operation succeeded. 
       
      * **FAIL** : The operation failed. For the failure reason, see ``ErrorMessage`` . 
       

      

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  If the response contains ``NextToken`` , submit another ``ListOperations`` request to get the next group of results. Specify the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response in the next request.

   

  .. note::

     

    Route 53 gets ``MaxResults`` operations and then filters them based on the specified criteria. It's possible that no operations in the first ``MaxResults`` operations matched the specified criteria but that subsequent groups of ``MaxResults`` operations do contain operations that match the criteria.
