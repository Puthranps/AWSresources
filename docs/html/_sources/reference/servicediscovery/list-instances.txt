Description

Lists summary information about the instances that you registered by using a specified service.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``list-instances`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Instances``

Options

``--service-id`` (string)


  The ID of the service that you want to list instances for.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output

Instances -> (list)

  

  Summary information about the instances that are associated with the specified service.

  

  (structure)

    

    A complex type that contains information about the instances that you registered by using a specified service.

    

    Id -> (string)

      

      The ID for an instance that you created by using a specified service.

      

      

    Attributes -> (map)

      

      A string map that contains the following information:

       

       
      * The attributes that are associate with the instance.  
       
      * For each attribute, the applicable value. 
       

       

      Supported attribute keys include the following:

       

       
      * ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` : For an alias record that routes traffic to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer.  
       
      * ``AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME`` : For a CNAME record, the domain name that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries, for example, ``example.com`` . 
       
      * ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` : For an A record, the IPv4 address that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries, for example, ``192.0.2.44`` . 
       
      * ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` : For an AAAA record, the IPv6 address that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries, for example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . 
       
      * ``AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`` : For an SRV record, the value that Route 53 returns for the port. In addition, if the service includes ``HealthCheckConfig`` , the port on the endpoint that Route 53 sends requests to. 
       

      

      key -> (string)

        

        

      value -> (string)

        

        

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  If more than ``MaxResults`` instances match the specified criteria, you can submit another ``ListInstances`` request to get the next group of results. Specify the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response in the next request.
