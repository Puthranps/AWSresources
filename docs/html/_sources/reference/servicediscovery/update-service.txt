.. _cli:aws servicediscovery update-service:


**************
update-service
**************



===========
Description
===========



Submits a request to perform the following operations:

 

 
* Add or delete ``DnsRecords`` configurations 
 
* Update the TTL setting for existing ``DnsRecords`` configurations 
 
* Add, update, or delete ``HealthCheckConfig`` for a specified service 
 

 

You must specify all ``DnsRecords`` configurations (and, optionally, ``HealthCheckConfig`` ) that you want to appear in the updated service. Any current configurations that don't appear in an ``UpdateService`` request are deleted.

 

When you update the TTL setting for a service, Amazon Route 53 also updates the corresponding settings in all the records and health checks that were created by using the specified service.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
