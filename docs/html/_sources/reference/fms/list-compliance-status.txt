    list-compliance-status

=======
Options
=======

``--policy-id`` (string)


  The ID of the AWS Firewall Manager policy that you want the details for.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  If you specify a value for ``MaxResults`` and you have more ``PolicyComplianceStatus`` objects than the number that you specify for ``MaxResults`` , AWS Firewall Manager returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response that allows you to list another group of ``PolicyComplianceStatus`` objects. For the second and subsequent ``ListComplianceStatus`` requests, specify the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response to get information about another batch of ``PolicyComplianceStatus`` objects.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Specifies the number of ``PolicyComplianceStatus`` objects that you want AWS Firewall Manager to return for this request. If you have more ``PolicyComplianceStatus`` objects than the number that you specify for ``MaxResults`` , the response includes a ``NextToken`` value that you can use to get another batch of ``PolicyComplianceStatus`` objects.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
