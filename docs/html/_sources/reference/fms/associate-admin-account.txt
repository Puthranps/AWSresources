  The AWS account ID to associate with AWS Firewall Manager as the AWS Firewall Manager administrator account. This can be an AWS Organizations master account or a member account. For more information about AWS Organizations and master accounts, see `Managing the AWS Accounts in Your Organization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts.html>`__ .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
