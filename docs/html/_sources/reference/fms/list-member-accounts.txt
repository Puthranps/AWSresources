Synopsis

    list-member-accounts
  [--next-token <value>]

  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--next-token`` (string)


  If you specify a value for ``MaxResults`` and you have more account IDs than the number that you specify for ``MaxResults`` , AWS Firewall Manager returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response that allows you to list another group of IDs. For the second and subsequent ``ListMemberAccountsRequest`` requests, specify the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response to get information about another batch of member account IDs.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Specifies the number of member account IDs that you want AWS Firewall Manager to return for this request. If you have more IDs than the number that you specify for ``MaxResults`` , the response includes a ``NextToken`` value that you can use to get another batch of member account IDs. The maximum value for ``MaxResults`` is 100.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

  An array of account IDs.

  

  (string)

    

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  If you have more member account IDs than the number that you specified for ``MaxResults`` in the request, the response includes a ``NextToken`` value. To list more IDs, submit another ``ListMemberAccounts`` request, and specify the ``NextToken`` value from the response in the ``NextToken`` value in the next request.
