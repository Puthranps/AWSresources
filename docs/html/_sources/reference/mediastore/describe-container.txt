===========
Description
===========



Retrieves the properties of the requested container. This request is commonly used to retrieve the endpoint of a container. An endpoint is a value assigned by the service when a new container is created. A container's endpoint does not change after it has been assigned. The ``DescribeContainer`` request returns a single ``Container`` object based on ``ContainerName`` . To return all ``Container`` objects that are associated with a specified AWS account, use  ListContainers .

``--container-name`` (string)


  The name of the container to query.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
