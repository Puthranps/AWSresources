=======
Options
=======

``--device-id`` (string)


  The unique identifier of the device.

  

``--from-time-stamp`` (timestamp)


  The start date for the device event query, in ISO8061 format. For example, 2018-03-28T15:45:12.880Z 

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of results to return per request. If not set, a default value of 100 is used.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token to retrieve the next set of results.

  

``--to-time-stamp`` (timestamp)


  The end date for the device event query, in ISO8061 format. For example, 2018-03-28T15:45:12.880Z 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
