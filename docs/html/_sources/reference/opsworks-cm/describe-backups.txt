===========
Description
===========



Describes backups. The results are ordered by time, with newest backups first. If you do not specify a BackupId or ServerName, the command returns all backups. 

 

This operation is synchronous. 

 

A ``ResourceNotFoundException`` is thrown when the backup does not exist. A ``ValidationException`` is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.

=======
Options
=======

``--backup-id`` (string)


  Describes a single backup. 

  

``--server-name`` (string)


  Returns backups for the server with the specified ServerName. 

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  This is not currently implemented for ``DescribeBackups`` requests.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  This is not currently implemented for ``DescribeBackups`` requests.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples

**To describe backups**

The following ``describe-backups`` command returns information about all backups
associated with your account in your default region.::

  aws opsworks-cm describe-backups

The output for each backup entry returned by the command resembles the following.
