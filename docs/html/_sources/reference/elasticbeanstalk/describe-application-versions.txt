Synopsis

::

    describe-application-versions
  [--application-name <value>]
  [--version-labels <value>]
  [--max-records <value>]
  [--next-token <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--application-name`` (string)


  Specify an application name to show only application versions for that application.

  

``--version-labels`` (list)


  Specify a version label to show a specific application version.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--max-records`` (integer)


  For a paginated request. Specify a maximum number of application versions to include in each response.

   

  If no ``MaxRecords`` is specified, all available application versions are retrieved in a single response.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  For a paginated request. Specify a token from a previous response page to retrieve the next response page. All other parameter values must be identical to the ones specified in the initial request.

   

  If no ``NextToken`` is specified, the first page is retrieved.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples

**To view information about an application version**

The following command retrieves information about an application version labeled ``v2``::

  aws elasticbeanstalk describe-application-versions --application-name my-app --version-label "v2"

Output::

  {
      "ApplicationVersions": [
          {
              "ApplicationName": "my-app",
