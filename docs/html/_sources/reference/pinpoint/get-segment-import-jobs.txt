=======
Options
=======

``--application-id`` (string)
The unique ID of your Amazon Pinpoint application.

``--page-size`` (string)
The number of entries you want on each page in the response.

``--segment-id`` (string)
The unique ID of the segment.

``--token`` (string)
The NextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get the next page of results in a paginated response.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
