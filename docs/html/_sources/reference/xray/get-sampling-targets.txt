Requests a sampling quota for rules that the service is using to sample requests.

``--sampling-statistics-documents`` (list)


  Information about rules that the service is using to sample requests.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    RuleName=string,ClientID=string,Timestamp=timestamp,RequestCount=integer,SampledCount=integer,BorrowCount=integer ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "RuleName": "string",
      "ClientID": "string",
      "Timestamp": timestamp,
      "RequestCount": integer,
      "SampledCount": integer,
      "BorrowCount": integer
    }
    ...
  ]



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

SamplingTargetDocuments -> (list)

  

  Updated rules that the service should use to sample requests.

  

  (structure)

    

    Temporary changes to a sampling rule configuration. To meet the global sampling target for a rule, X-Ray calculates a new reservoir for each service based on the recent sampling results of all services that called  GetSamplingTargets .

    

    RuleName -> (string)

      

      The name of the sampling rule.

      

      

    FixedRate -> (double)

      

      The percentage of matching requests to instrument, after the reservoir is exhausted.

      

      

    ReservoirQuota -> (integer)

      

      The number of requests per second that X-Ray allocated this service.

      

      

    ReservoirQuotaTTL -> (timestamp)

      

      When the reservoir quota expires.

      

      

    Interval -> (integer)

      

      The number of seconds for the service to wait before getting sampling targets again.

      

      

    

  

LastRuleModification -> (timestamp)

  

  The last time a user changed the sampling rule configuration. If the sampling rule configuration changed since the service last retrieved it, the service should call  GetSamplingRules to get the latest version.

  

  

UnprocessedStatistics -> (list)

  

  Information about  SamplingStatisticsDocument that X-Ray could not process.

  

  (structure)

    

    Sampling statistics from a call to  GetSamplingTargets that X-Ray could not process.

    

    RuleName -> (string)

      

      The name of the sampling rule.

      

      

    ErrorCode -> (string)

      

      The error code.

      

      

    Message -> (string)

      

      The error message.
