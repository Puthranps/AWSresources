===========
Description
===========



Retrieves a list of traces specified by ID. Each trace is a collection of segment documents that originates from a single request. Use ``GetTraceSummaries`` to get a list of trace IDs.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/xray-2016-04-12/BatchGetTraces>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``batch-get-traces`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Traces``

``--trace-ids`` (list)


  Specify the trace IDs of requests for which to retrieve segments.

  



Syntax::

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

Traces -> (list)

  

  Full traces for the specified requests.

  

  (structure)

    

    A collection of segment documents with matching trace IDs.

    

    Id -> (string)

      

      The unique identifier for the request that generated the trace's segments and subsegments.

      

      

    Duration -> (double)

      

      The length of time in seconds between the start time of the root segment and the end time of the last segment that completed.

      

      

    Segments -> (list)

      

      Segment documents for the segments and subsegments that comprise the trace.

      

      (structure)

        

        A segment from a trace that has been ingested by the X-Ray service. The segment can be compiled from documents uploaded with  PutTraceSegments , or an ``inferred`` segment for a downstream service, generated from a subsegment sent by the service that called it.

         

        For the full segment document schema, see `AWS X-Ray Segment Documents <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html>`__ in the *AWS X-Ray Developer Guide* .

        

        Id -> (string)

          

          The segment's ID.

          

          

        Document -> (string)

          

          The segment document.

          

          

        

      

    

  

UnprocessedTraceIds -> (list)

  

  Trace IDs of requests that haven't been processed.

  

  (string)

    

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  Pagination token. Not used.
