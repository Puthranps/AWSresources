get-service-graph

===========
Description
===========



Retrieves a document that describes services that process incoming requests, and downstream services that they call as a result. Root services process incoming requests and make calls to downstream services. Root services are applications that use the AWS X-Ray SDK. Downstream services can be other applications, AWS resources, HTTP web APIs, or SQL databases.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/xray-2016-04-12/GetServiceGraph>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``get-service-graph`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Services``

=======
Options
=======

``--start-time`` (timestamp)


  The start of the time frame for which to generate a graph.

  

``--end-time`` (timestamp)


  The end of the time frame for which to generate a graph.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
