******************
export-certificate
******************



===========
Description
===========



Exports a private certificate issued by a private certificate authority (CA) for use anywhere. You can export the certificate, the certificate chain, and the encrypted private key associated with the public key embedded in the certificate. You must store the private key securely. The private key is a 2048 bit RSA key. You must provide a passphrase for the private key when exporting it. You can use the following OpenSSL command to decrypt it later. Provide the passphrase when prompted. 

 

 ``openssl rsa -in encrypted_key.pem -out decrypted_key.pem``

    export-certificate
  --certificate-arn <value>
  --passphrase <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--certificate-arn`` (string)


  An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the issued certificate. This must be of the form:

   

   ``arn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012``  

  

``--passphrase`` (blob)


  Passphrase to associate with the encrypted exported private key. If you want to later decrypt the private key, you must have the passphrase. You can use the following OpenSSL command to decrypt a private key: 

   

   ``openssl rsa -in encrypted_key.pem -out decrypted_key.pem``  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
