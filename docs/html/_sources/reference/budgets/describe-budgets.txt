=======
Options
=======

``--account-id`` (string)


  The ``accountId`` that is associated with the budgets that you want descriptions of.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Optional integer. Specifies the maximum number of results to return in response.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The pagination token that indicates the next set of results to retrieve.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

      If you created your budget and didn't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (i.e. DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24th 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API. 

       

      You can change either date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

       

      After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and subscribers.

      

      Start -> (timestamp)
