Options
=======

``--account-id`` (string)


  The ``accountId`` that is associated with the budget whose notifications you want descriptions of.

  

``--budget-name`` (string)


  The name of the budget whose notifications you want descriptions of.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Optional integer. Specifies the maximum number of results to return in response.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The pagination token that indicates the next set of results to retrieve.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output

Notifications -> (list)

  

  A list of notifications associated with a budget.

  

  (structure)

    

    A notification associated with a budget. A budget can have up to five notifications. 

     

    Each notification must have at least one subscriber. A notification can have one SNS subscriber and up to ten email subscribers, for a total of 11 subscribers.

     

    For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you want to be notified when you go over 160 dollars, create a notification with the following parameters:

     

     
    * A notificationType of ``ACTUAL``   
     
    * A comparisonOperator of ``GREATER_THAN``   
     
    * A notification threshold of ``80``   
     

    

    NotificationType -> (string)

      

      Whether the notification is for how much you have spent (``ACTUAL`` ) or for how much you are forecasted to spend (``FORECASTED`` ).

      

      

    ComparisonOperator -> (string)

      

      The comparison used for this notification.

      

      

    Threshold -> (double)

      

      The threshold associated with a notification. Thresholds are always a percentage.

      

      

    ThresholdType -> (string)

      

      The type of threshold for a notification. For ``ACTUAL`` thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over the threshold, and for ``FORECASTED`` thresholds AWS notifies you when you are forecasted to go over the threshold.

      

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  The pagination token that indicates the next set of results that you can retrieve.
