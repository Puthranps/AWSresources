    start-channel
  --channel-id <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--channel-id`` (string)
A request to start a channel

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

          Mode -> (string)

            If "vod", all segments are indexed and kept permanently in the destination and manifest. If "live", only the number segments specified in keepSegments and indexNSegments are kept; newer segments replace older segments, which may prevent players from rewinding all the way to the beginning of the event. VOD mode uses HLS EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE of EVENT while the channel is running, converting it to a "VOD" type manifest on completion of the stream.

            

          OutputSelection -> (string)

            Generates the .m3u8 playlist file for this HLS output group. The segmentsOnly option will output segments without the .m3u8 file.

          EventIdMode -> (string)

            Specifies whether or not to send an event ID to the IIS server. If no event ID is sent and the same Live Event is used without changing the publishing point, clients might see cached video from the previous run. Options: - "useConfigured" - use the value provided in eventId - "useTimestamp" - generate and send an event ID based on the current timestamp - "noEventId" - do not send an event ID to the IIS server.

            When set to useInputSegmentation, the output segment or fragment points are set by the RAI markers from the input streams.

            

          SendDelayMs -> (integer)

            Outputs that are "output locked" can use this delay. Assign a delay to the output that is "secondary". Do not assign a delay to the "primary" output. The delay means that the primary output will always reach the downstream system before the secondary, which helps ensure that the downstream system always uses the primary output. (If there were no delay, the downstream system might flip-flop between whichever output happens to arrive first.) If the primary fails, the downstream system will switch to the secondary output. When the primary is restarted, the downstream system will switch back to the primary (because once again it is always arriving first)

            

          SparseTrackType -> (string)

            If set to scte35, use incoming SCTE-35 messages to generate a sparse track in this group of MS-Smooth outputs.

            Controls behavior when content cache fills up. If remote origin server stalls the RTMP connection and does not accept content fast enough the 'Media Cache' will fill up. When the cache reaches the duration specified by cacheLength the cache will stop accepting new content. If set to disconnectImmediately, the RTMP output will force a disconnect. Clear the media cache, and reconnect after restartDelay seconds. If set to waitForServer, the RTMP output will wait up to 5 minutes to allow the origin server to begin accepting data again.

            

          CacheLength -> (integer)

            Cache length, in seconds, is used to calculate buffer size.

If set to 'field1608' then only the data carried in 608 from field 1 video will be passed.

            

          RestartDelay -> (integer)

            If a streaming output fails, number of seconds to wait until a restart is initiated. A value of 0 means never restart.

          InputLossAction -> (string)

            Specifies behavior of last resort when input video is lost, and no more backup inputs are available. When dropTs is selected the entire transport stream will stop being emitted. When dropProgram is selected the program can be dropped from the transport stream (and replaced with null packets to meet the TS bitrate requirement). Or, when emitProgram is chosen the transport stream will continue to be produced normally with repeat frames, black frames, or slate frames substituted for the absent input video.

This means the subsequent segment will have a duration of $segmentationTime seconds. When a segmentation style of "maintainCadence" is selected and a segment is truncated due to an avail, we will not reset the segmentation cadence. This means the subsequent segment will likely be truncated as well. However, all segments after that will have a duration of $segmentationTime seconds. Note that EBP lookahead is a slight exception to this rule.

                  SegmentationStyle -> (string)

                    The segmentation style parameter controls how segmentation markers are inserted into the transport stream. With avails, it is possible that segments may be truncated, which can influence where future segmentation markers are inserted. When a segmentation style of "resetCadence" is selected and a segment is truncated due to an avail, we will reset the segmentation cadence. This means the subsequent segment will have a duration of $segmentationTime seconds. When a segmentation style of "maintainCadence" is selected and a segment is truncated due to an avail, we will not reset the segmentation cadence. This means the subsequent segment will likely be truncated as well. However, all segments after that will have a duration of $segmentationTime seconds. Note that EBP lookahead is a slight exception to this rule.

                    

                  SegmentationTime -> (double)

                    The length in seconds of each segment. Required unless markers is set to None_.
