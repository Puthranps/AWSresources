Description

Produces list of channels that have been created

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``list-channels`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Channels``

Synopsis

::

    list-channels
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--starting-token <value>]
  [--page-size <value>]
  [--max-items <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              Bandwidth -> (integer)

                When specified the HLS stream with the m3u8 BANDWIDTH that most closely matches this value will be chosen, otherwise the highest bandwidth stream in the m3u8 will be chosen. The bitrate is specified in bits per second, as in an HLS manifest.

                

              BufferSegments -> (integer)

                When specified, reading of the HLS input will begin this many buffer segments from the end (most recently written segment). When not specified, the HLS input will begin with the first segment specified in the m3u8.

                

              Retries -> (integer)

                The number of consecutive times that attempts to read a manifest or segment must fail before the input is considered unavailable.

                

              RetryInterval -> (integer)

                The number of seconds between retries when an attempt to read a manifest or segment fails.

                

              

            ServerValidation -> (string)

              Check HTTPS server certificates. When set to checkCryptographyOnly, cryptography in the certificate will be checked, but not the server's name. Certain subdomains (notably S3 buckets that use dots in the bucket name) do not strictly match the corresponding certificate's wildcard pattern and would otherwise cause the event to error. This setting is ignored for protocols that do not use https.

              

            

          SourceEndBehavior -> (string)

            Loop input if it is a file. This allows a file input to be streamed indefinitely.

            

          VideoSelector -> (structure)

            Informs which video elementary stream to decode for input types that have multiple available.

            ColorSpace -> (string)

              Specifies the colorspace of an input. This setting works in tandem with colorSpaceConversion to determine if any conversion will be performed.

              

            ColorSpaceUsage -> (string)

              Applies only if colorSpace is a value other than follow. This field controls how the value in the colorSpace field will be used. fallback means that when the input does include color space data, that data will be used, but when the input has no color space data, the value in colorSpace will be used. Choose fallback if your input is sometimes missing color space data, but when it does have color space data, that data is correct. force means to always use the value in colorSpace. Choose force if your input usually has no color space data or might have unreliable color space data.

              

            SelectorSettings -> (structure)

              The video selector settings.

                ProgramId -> (integer)
