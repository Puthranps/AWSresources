===========
Description
===========



You can call  DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications to learn what modifications you can make to your DB instance. You can use this information when you call  ModifyDBInstance .

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

=======
Options
=======

``--db-instance-identifier`` (string)


  The customer identifier or the ARN of your DB instance. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output
======

ValidDBInstanceModificationsMessage -> (structure)

  

  Information about valid modifications that you can make to your DB instance. Contains the result of a successful call to the  DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications action. You can use this information when you call  ModifyDBInstance . 

  

  Storage -> (list)

    

    Valid storage options for your DB instance. 

    

    (structure)

      

      Information about valid modifications that you can make to your DB instance. Contains the result of a successful call to the  DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications action. 

      

      StorageType -> (string)

        

        The valid storage types for your DB instance. For example, gp2, io1. 

        

        

      StorageSize -> (list)

        

        The valid range of storage in gibibytes. For example, 100 to 16384. 

        

        (structure)

          

          A range of integer values.

          

          From -> (integer)

            

            The minimum value in the range.

            

            

          To -> (integer)

            

            The maximum value in the range.

            

            

          Step -> (integer)

            

            The step value for the range. For example, if you have a range of 5,000 to 10,000, with a step value of 1,000, the valid values start at 5,000 and step up by 1,000. Even though 7,500 is within the range, it isn't a valid value for the range. The valid values are 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000... 

            

            

          

        

      ProvisionedIops -> (list)

        

        The valid range of provisioned IOPS. For example, 1000-20000. 

        

        (structure)

          

          A range of integer values.

          

          From -> (integer)

            

            The minimum value in the range.

            

            

          To -> (integer)

            

            The maximum value in the range.

            

            

          Step -> (integer)

            

            The step value for the range. For example, if you have a range of 5,000 to 10,000, with a step value of 1,000, the valid values start at 5,000 and step up by 1,000. Even though 7,500 is within the range, it isn't a valid value for the range. The valid values are 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000... 

            

            

          

        

      IopsToStorageRatio -> (list)

        

        The valid range of Provisioned IOPS to gibibytes of storage multiplier. For example, 3-10, which means that provisioned IOPS can be between 3 and 10 times storage. 

        

        (structure)

          

          A range of double values.

          To -> (double)

            

            The maximum value in the range.
