Description
===========



Creates a new Amazon Neptune DB cluster.

 

You can use the ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` parameter to create the DB cluster as a Read Replica of another DB cluster or Amazon Neptune DB instance. For cross-region replication where the DB cluster identified by ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` is encrypted, you must also specify the ``PreSignedUrl`` parameter.

JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",
      "Value": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--storage-encrypted`` | ``--no-storage-encrypted`` (boolean)


  Specifies whether the DB cluster is encrypted.

  

``--kms-key-id`` (string)


  The AWS KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB cluster.

   

  The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are creating a DB cluster with the same AWS account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new DB cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KMS encryption key.

   

  If an encryption key is not specified in ``KmsKeyId`` :

   

   
  * If ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` identifies an encrypted source, then Amazon Neptune will use the encryption key used to encrypt the source. Otherwise, Amazon Neptune will use your default encryption key.  
   
  * If the ``StorageEncrypted`` parameter is true and ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` is not specified, then Amazon Neptune will use your default encryption key. 
   

   

  AWS KMS creates the default encryption key for your AWS account. Your AWS account has a different default encryption key for each AWS Region.

   

  If you create a Read Replica of an encrypted DB cluster in another AWS Region, you must set ``KmsKeyId`` to a KMS key ID that is valid in the destination AWS Region. This key is used to encrypt the Read Replica in that AWS Region.

  

``--pre-signed-url`` (string)


  A URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the ``CreateDBCluster`` action to be called in the source AWS Region where the DB cluster is replicated from. You only need to specify ``PreSignedUrl`` when you are performing cross-region replication from an encrypted DB cluster.

   

  The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the ``CreateDBCluster`` API action that can be executed in the source AWS Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster to be copied.

   

  The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values:

   

   
  * ``KmsKeyId`` - The AWS KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster in the destination AWS Region. This should refer to the same KMS key for both the ``CreateDBCluster`` action that is called in the destination AWS Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL. 
   
  * ``DestinationRegion`` - The name of the AWS Region that Read Replica will be created in. 
   
  * ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` - The DB cluster identifier for the encrypted DB cluster to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source AWS Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster from the us-west-2 AWS Region, then your ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` would look like Example: ``arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:neptune-cluster1`` . 
   

   

  To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see `Authenticating Requests\: Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4) <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html>`__ and `Signature Version 4 Signing Process <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`__ .

  

``--enable-iam-database-authentication`` | ``--no-enable-iam-database-authentication`` (boolean)


  True to enable mapping of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts, and otherwise false.

   

  Default: ``false``  

  

``--source-region`` (string)


  The ID of the region that contains the source for the db cluster.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

  Contains the details of an Amazon Neptune DB cluster. 

   

  This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClusters action. 

  

  AllocatedStorage -> (integer)

    

     ``AllocatedStorage`` always returns 1, because Neptune DB cluster storage size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as needed.

    

    

  AvailabilityZones -> (list)

    

    Provides the list of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in the DB cluster can be created in.

    

    (string)

      

      

    

  BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)

    

    Specifies the number of days for which automatic DB snapshots are retained.

    

    

  CharacterSetName -> (string)

    

    If present, specifies the name of the character set that this cluster is associated with.

    

    

  DatabaseName -> (string)

    

    Contains the name of the initial database of this DB cluster that was provided at create time, if one was specified when the DB cluster was created. This same name is returned for the life of the DB cluster.

    

    

  DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)

    

    Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

    

    

  DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)

    

    Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB cluster.

    

    

  DBSubnetGroup -> (string)

    

    Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB cluster, including the name, description, and subnets in the subnet group.

    

    

  Status -> (string)

    

    Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

    

    

  PercentProgress -> (string)

    

    Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

As clients request new connections to the reader endpoint, Neptune distributes the connection requests among the Read Replicas in the DB cluster. This functionality can help balance your read workload across multiple Read Replicas in your DB cluster. 

     

    If a failover occurs, and the Read Replica that you are connected to is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other Read Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint.
