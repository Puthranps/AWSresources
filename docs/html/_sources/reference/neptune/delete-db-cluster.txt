delete-db-cluster
*****************



===========
Description
===========



The DeleteDBCluster action deletes a previously provisioned DB cluster. When you delete a DB cluster, all automated backups for that DB cluster are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB cluster snapshots of the specified DB cluster are not deleted.

=======
Options
=======

``--db-cluster-identifier`` (string)


  The DB cluster identifier for the DB cluster to be deleted. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier. 
   

  

``--skip-final-snapshot`` | ``--no-skip-final-snapshot`` (boolean)


  Determines whether a final DB cluster snapshot is created before the DB cluster is deleted. If ``true`` is specified, no DB cluster snapshot is created. If ``false`` is specified, a DB cluster snapshot is created before the DB cluster is deleted. 

   

  .. note::

     

    You must specify a ``FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier`` parameter if ``SkipFinalSnapshot`` is ``false`` .

     

   

  Default: ``false``  

  

``--final-db-snapshot-identifier`` (string)


  The DB cluster snapshot identifier of the new DB cluster snapshot created when ``SkipFinalSnapshot`` is set to ``false`` . 

   

  .. note::

     

    Specifying this parameter and also setting the ``SkipFinalShapshot`` parameter to true results in an error. 

     

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must be 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens. 
   
  * First character must be a letter 
   
  * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens 
   

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

DBCluster -> (structure)

  

  Contains the details of an Amazon Neptune DB cluster. 

   

  This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClusters action. 

  

  AllocatedStorage -> (integer)

    

     ``AllocatedStorage`` always returns 1, because Neptune DB cluster storage size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as needed.

    

    

  AvailabilityZones -> (list)

    

    Provides the list of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in the DB cluster can be created in.

    

    (string)

      

      

    

  BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)

    

    Specifies the number of days for which automatic DB snapshots are retained.

    

    

  CharacterSetName -> (string)

    

    If present, specifies the name of the character set that this cluster is associated with.

    

    

  DatabaseName -> (string)

    

    Contains the name of the initial database of this DB cluster that was provided at create time, if one was specified when the DB cluster was created. This same name is returned for the life of the DB cluster.

    

    

  DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)

    

    Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

    

    

  DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)

    

    Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB cluster.

    

    

  DBSubnetGroup -> (string)

    

    Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB cluster, including the name, description, and subnets in the subnet group.

    

    

  Status -> (string)

    

    Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

    

    

  PercentProgress -> (string)

    

    Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

    

    

  EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)

    

    Specifies the earliest time to which a database can be restored with point-in-time restore.

    

    

  Endpoint -> (string)

    

    Specifies the connection endpoint for the primary instance of the DB cluster.

    

    

  ReaderEndpoint -> (string)

    

    The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Read Replicas that are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new connections to the reader endpoint, Neptune distributes the connection requests among the Read Replicas in the DB cluster. This functionality can help balance your read workload across multiple Read Replicas in your DB cluster. 

     

    If a failover occurs, and the Read Replica that you are connected to is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other Read Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint.

    

    

  MultiAZ -> (boolean)

    

    Specifies whether the DB cluster has instances in multiple Availability Zones.

    

    

  Engine -> (string)
