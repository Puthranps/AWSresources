=======
Options

``--db-cluster-identifier`` (string)


  The ID of the DB cluster to retrieve the list of DB cluster snapshots for. This parameter can't be used in conjunction with the ``DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier`` parameter. This parameter is not case-sensitive. 

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster. 
   

  

``--db-cluster-snapshot-identifier`` (string)


  A specific DB cluster snapshot identifier to describe. This parameter can't be used in conjunction with the ``DBClusterIdentifier`` parameter. This value is stored as a lowercase string. 

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBClusterSnapshot. 
   
  * If this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the ``SnapshotType`` parameter must also be specified. 
   

  

``--snapshot-type`` (string)


  The type of DB cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of the following values:

   

   
  * ``automated`` - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been automatically taken by Amazon Neptune for my AWS account. 
   
  * ``manual`` - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been taken by my AWS account. 
   
  * ``shared`` - Return all manual DB cluster snapshots that have been shared to my AWS account. 
   
  * ``public`` - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been marked as public. 
   

   

  If you don't specify a ``SnapshotType`` value, then both automated and manual DB cluster snapshots are returned. You can include shared DB cluster snapshots with these results by setting the ``IncludeShared`` parameter to ``true`` . You can include public DB cluster snapshots with these results by setting the ``IncludePublic`` parameter to ``true`` .

   

  The ``IncludeShared`` and ``IncludePublic`` parameters don't apply for ``SnapshotType`` values of ``manual`` or ``automated`` . The ``IncludePublic`` parameter doesn't apply when ``SnapshotType`` is set to ``shared`` . The ``IncludeShared`` parameter doesn't apply when ``SnapshotType`` is set to ``public`` .

  

``--filters`` (list)


  This parameter is not currently supported.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Name=string,Values=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Name": "string",
      "Values": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--max-records`` (integer)


  The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved. 

   

  Default: 100

   

  Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.

  

``--marker`` (string)


  An optional pagination token provided by a previous ``DescribeDBClusterSnapshots`` request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by ``MaxRecords`` . 

  

``--include-shared`` | ``--no-include-shared`` (boolean)


  True to include shared manual DB cluster snapshots from other AWS accounts that this AWS account has been given permission to copy or restore, and otherwise false. The default is ``false`` .

   

  You can give an AWS account permission to restore a manual DB cluster snapshot from another AWS account by the  ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute API action.

  

``--include-public`` | ``--no-include-public`` (boolean)


  True to include manual DB cluster snapshots that are public and can be copied or restored by any AWS account, and otherwise false. The default is ``false`` . The default is false.

   

  You can share a manual DB cluster snapshot as public by using the  ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute API action.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
