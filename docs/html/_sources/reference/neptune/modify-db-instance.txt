Options
=======

``--db-instance-identifier`` (string)


  The DB instance identifier. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance. 
   

  

``--allocated-storage`` (integer)


  The new amount of storage (in gibibytes) to allocate for the DB instance. 

   

  Not applicable. Storage is managed by the DB Cluster.

  

``--db-instance-class`` (string)


  The new compute and memory capacity of the DB instance, for example, ``db.m4.large`` . Not all DB instance classes are available in all AWS Regions. 

   

  If you modify the DB instance class, an outage occurs during the change. The change is applied during the next maintenance window, unless ``ApplyImmediately`` is specified as ``true`` for this request. 

   

  Default: Uses existing setting

  

``--db-subnet-group-name`` (string)


  The new DB subnet group for the DB instance. You can use this parameter to move your DB instance to a different VPC. 

   

  Changing the subnet group causes an outage during the change. The change is applied during the next maintenance window, unless you specify ``true`` for the ``ApplyImmediately`` parameter. 

   

  Constraints: If supplied, must match the name of an existing DBSubnetGroup.

   

  Example: ``mySubnetGroup``  

  

``--db-security-groups`` (list)


  A list of DB security groups to authorize on this DB instance. Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * If supplied, must match existing DBSecurityGroups. 
   

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--vpc-security-group-ids`` (list)


  A list of EC2 VPC security groups to authorize on this DB instance. This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

   

  Not applicable. The associated list of EC2 VPC security groups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see  ModifyDBCluster .

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * If supplied, must match existing VpcSecurityGroupIds. 
   

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--apply-immediately`` | ``--no-apply-immediately`` (boolean)


  Specifies whether the modifications in this request and any pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of the ``PreferredMaintenanceWindow`` setting for the DB instance. 

   

  If this parameter is set to ``false`` , changes to the DB instance are applied during the next maintenance window. Some parameter changes can cause an outage and are applied on the next call to  RebootDBInstance , or the next failure reboot. 

   

  Default: ``false``  

  

``--master-user-password`` (string)


  The new password for the master user. The password can include any printable ASCII character except "/", """, or "@".

   

  Not applicable. 

   

  Default: Uses existing setting

  

``--db-parameter-group-name`` (string)


  The name of the DB parameter group to apply to the DB instance. Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage. The parameter group name itself is changed immediately, but the actual parameter changes are not applied until you reboot the instance without failover. The db instance will NOT be rebooted automatically and the parameter changes will NOT be applied during the next maintenance window.

   

  Default: Uses existing setting

   

  Constraints: The DB parameter group must be in the same DB parameter group family as this DB instance.

  

``--backup-retention-period`` (integer)


  The number of days to retain automated backups. Setting this parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables automated backups.

   

  Not applicable. The retention period for automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see  ModifyDBCluster .

   

  Default: Uses existing setting

  

``--preferred-backup-window`` (string)


  The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled. 

   

  Not applicable. The daily time range for creating automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see  ModifyDBCluster .

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must be in the format hh24:mi-hh24:mi 
   
  * Must be in Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) 
   
  * Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window 
   
  * Must be at least 30 minutes 
   

  

``--preferred-maintenance-window`` (string)


  The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can occur, which might result in an outage. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage, except in the following situation, and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If there are pending actions that cause a reboot, and the maintenance window is changed to include the current time, then changing this parameter will cause a reboot of the DB instance. If moving this window to the current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the current time and end of the window to ensure pending changes are applied.

   

  Default: Uses existing setting

   

  Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

   

  Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun

   

  Constraints: Must be at least 30 minutes

  

``--multi-az`` | ``--no-multi-az`` (boolean)


  Specifies if the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the ``ApplyImmediately`` parameter is set to ``true`` for this request. 

  

``--engine-version`` (string)


  The version number of the database engine to upgrade to. Changing this parameter results in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the ``ApplyImmediately`` parameter is set to ``true`` for this request. 

   

  For major version upgrades, if a nondefault DB parameter group is currently in use, a new DB parameter group in the DB parameter group family for the new engine version must be specified. The new DB parameter group can be the default for that DB parameter group family.

  

``--allow-major-version-upgrade`` | ``--no-allow-major-version-upgrade`` (boolean)


  Indicates that major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

   

  Constraints: This parameter must be set to true when specifying a value for the EngineVersion parameter that is a different major version than the DB instance's current version.

  

``--auto-minor-version-upgrade`` | ``--no-auto-minor-version-upgrade`` (boolean)


  Indicates that minor version upgrades are applied automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage except in the following case and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. An outage will result if this parameter is set to ``true`` during the maintenance window, and a newer minor version is available, and Neptune has enabled auto patching for that engine version. 

  

``--license-model`` (string)


  The license model for the DB instance.

   

  Valid values: ``license-included`` | ``bring-your-own-license`` | ``general-public-license``  

  

``--iops`` (integer)


  The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the instance. 

   

  Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the ``ApplyImmediately`` parameter is set to ``true`` for this request.

   

  Default: Uses existing setting

  

``--option-group-name`` (string)


  Indicates that the DB instance should be associated with the specified option group. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage except in the following case and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the ``ApplyImmediately`` parameter is set to ``true`` for this request. If the parameter change results in an option group that enables OEM, this change can cause a brief (sub-second) period during which new connections are rejected but existing connections are not interrupted. 

   

  Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security TDE, can't be removed from an option group, and that option group can't be removed from a DB instance once it is associated with a DB instance

  

``--new-db-instance-identifier`` (string)


  The new DB instance identifier for the DB instance when renaming a DB instance. When you change the DB instance identifier, an instance reboot will occur immediately if you set ``Apply Immediately`` to true, or will occur during the next maintenance window if ``Apply Immediately`` to false. This value is stored as a lowercase string. 

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens. 
   
  * The first character must be a letter. 
   
  * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. 
   

   

  Example: ``mydbinstance``  

  

``--storage-type`` (string)


  Specifies the storage type to be associated with the DB instance. 

   

  If you specify Provisioned IOPS (``io1`` ), you must also include a value for the ``Iops`` parameter. 

   

  If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to using standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB instance is available for use, but might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance are suspended. No other Amazon Neptune operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a Read Replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance. 

   

  Valid values: ``standard | gp2 | io1``  

   

  Default: ``io1`` if the ``Iops`` parameter is specified, otherwise ``standard``  

  

``--tde-credential-arn`` (string)


  The ARN from the key store with which to associate the instance for TDE encryption.

  

``--tde-credential-password`` (string)


  The password for the given ARN from the key store in order to access the device.

  

``--ca-certificate-identifier`` (string)


  Indicates the certificate that needs to be associated with the instance.

  

``--domain`` (string)


  Not supported. 

  

``--copy-tags-to-snapshot`` | ``--no-copy-tags-to-snapshot`` (boolean)


  True to copy all tags from the DB instance to snapshots of the DB instance, and otherwise false. The default is false.

  

``--monitoring-interval`` (integer)


  The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collecting Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0.

   

  If ``MonitoringRoleArn`` is specified, then you must also set ``MonitoringInterval`` to a value other than 0.

   

  Valid Values: ``0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60``  

  

``--db-port-number`` (integer)


  The port number on which the database accepts connections.

   

  The value of the ``DBPortNumber`` parameter must not match any of the port values specified for options in the option group for the DB instance.

   

  Your database will restart when you change the ``DBPortNumber`` value regardless of the value of the ``ApplyImmediately`` parameter.

   

  Default: ``8182``  

  

``--publicly-accessible`` | ``--no-publicly-accessible`` (boolean)


  This parameter is not supported.

  

``--monitoring-role-arn`` (string)


  The ARN for the IAM role that permits Neptune to send enhanced monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For example, ``arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess`` . 

   

  If ``MonitoringInterval`` is set to a value other than 0, then you must supply a ``MonitoringRoleArn`` value.

  

``--domain-iam-role-name`` (string)


  Not supported

  

``--promotion-tier`` (integer)


  A value that specifies the order in which a Read Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a failure of the existing primary instance. 

   

  Default: 1

   

  Valid Values: 0 - 15

  

``--enable-iam-database-authentication`` | ``--no-enable-iam-database-authentication`` (boolean)


  True to enable mapping of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts, and otherwise false.

   

  You can enable IAM database authentication for the following database engines

   

  Not applicable. Mapping AWS IAM accounts to database accounts is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see  ModifyDBCluster .

   

  Default: ``false``  

  

``--enable-performance-insights`` | ``--no-enable-performance-insights`` (boolean)


  True to enable Performance Insights for the DB instance, and otherwise false.

  

``--performance-insights-kms-key-id`` (string)


  The AWS KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data. The KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key alias for the KMS encryption key.

  

``--cloudwatch-logs-export-configuration`` (structure)


  The configuration setting for the log types to be enabled for export to CloudWatch Logs for a specific DB instance or DB cluster.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    EnableLogTypes=string,string,DisableLogTypes=string,string
