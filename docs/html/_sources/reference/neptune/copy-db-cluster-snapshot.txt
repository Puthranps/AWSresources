===========
Description
===========



Copies a snapshot of a DB cluster.

 

To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot, ``SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier`` must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB cluster snapshot.

 

You can copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another AWS Region. In that case, the AWS Region where you call the ``CopyDBClusterSnapshot`` action is the destination AWS Region for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied to. To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another AWS Region, you must provide the following values:

 

 
* ``KmsKeyId`` - The AWS Key Management System (AWS KMS) key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region. 
 
* ``PreSignedUrl`` - A URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the ``CopyDBClusterSnapshot`` action to be called in the source AWS Region where the DB cluster snapshot is copied from. The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the ``CopyDBClusterSnapshot`` API action that can be executed in the source AWS Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values: 

   
  * ``KmsKeyId`` - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region. This is the same identifier for both the ``CopyDBClusterSnapshot`` action that is called in the destination AWS Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL. 
   
  * ``DestinationRegion`` - The name of the AWS Region that the DB cluster snapshot will be created in. 
   
  * ``SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier`` - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source AWS Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 AWS Region, then your ``SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier`` looks like the following example: ``arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:neptune-cluster1-snapshot-20161115`` . 
   

 

To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see `Authenticating Requests\: Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4) <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html>`__ and `Signature Version 4 Signing Process <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`__ .

 
 
* ``TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier`` - The identifier for the new copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region. 
 
* ``SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier`` - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the ARN format for the source AWS Region and is the same value as the ``SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier`` in the pre-signed URL.  
 

 

To cancel the copy operation once it is in progress, delete the target DB cluster snapshot identified by ``TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier`` while that DB cluster snapshot is in "copying" status.

Options

``--source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier`` (string)


  The identifier of the DB cluster snapshot to copy. This parameter is not case-sensitive.

   

  You can't copy an encrypted, shared DB cluster snapshot from one AWS Region to another.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must specify a valid system snapshot in the "available" state. 
   
  * If the source snapshot is in the same AWS Region as the copy, specify a valid DB snapshot identifier. 
   
  * If the source snapshot is in a different AWS Region than the copy, specify a valid DB cluster snapshot ARN.  
   

   

  Example: ``my-cluster-snapshot1``  

  

``--target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier`` (string)


  The identifier of the new DB cluster snapshot to create from the source DB cluster snapshot. This parameter is not case-sensitive.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens. 
   
  * First character must be a letter. 
   
  * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. 
   

   

  Example: ``my-cluster-snapshot2``  

  

``--kms-key-id`` (string)


  The AWS AWS KMS key ID for an encrypted DB cluster snapshot. The KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key alias for the KMS encryption key. 

   

  If you copy an unencrypted DB cluster snapshot and specify a value for the ``KmsKeyId`` parameter, Amazon Neptune encrypts the target DB cluster snapshot using the specified KMS encryption key. 

   

  If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from your AWS account, you can specify a value for ``KmsKeyId`` to encrypt the copy with a new KMS encryption key. If you don't specify a value for ``KmsKeyId`` , then the copy of the DB cluster snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB cluster snapshot. 

   

  If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot that is shared from another AWS account, then you must specify a value for ``KmsKeyId`` . 

   

  To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot to another AWS Region, you must set ``KmsKeyId`` to the KMS key ID you want to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region. KMS encryption keys are specific to the AWS Region that they are created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one AWS Region in another AWS Region.

  

``--pre-signed-url`` (string)


  The URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the ``CopyDBClusterSnapshot`` API action in the AWS Region that contains the source DB cluster snapshot to copy. The ``PreSignedUrl`` parameter must be used when copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another AWS Region.

   

  The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the ``CopyDBSClusterSnapshot`` API action that can be executed in the source AWS Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values:

   

   
  * ``KmsKeyId`` - The AWS KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region. This is the same identifier for both the ``CopyDBClusterSnapshot`` action that is called in the destination AWS Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL. 
   
  * ``DestinationRegion`` - The name of the AWS Region that the DB cluster snapshot will be created in. 
   
  * ``SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier`` - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source AWS Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 AWS Region, then your ``SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier`` looks like the following example: ``arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:neptune-cluster1-snapshot-20161115`` . 
   

   

  To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see `Authenticating Requests\: Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4) <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html>`__ and `Signature Version 4 Signing Process <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`__ .

  

``--copy-tags`` | ``--no-copy-tags`` (boolean)


  True to copy all tags from the source DB cluster snapshot to the target DB cluster snapshot, and otherwise false. The default is false.

  

``--tags`` (list)


  A list of tags. For more information, see `Tagging Amazon Neptune Resources <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/UserGuide/tagging.ARN.html>`__ .

JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",

    ...
  ]



``--source-region`` (string)


  The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
