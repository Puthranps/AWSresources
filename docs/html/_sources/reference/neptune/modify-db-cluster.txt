=======
Options
=======

``--db-cluster-identifier`` (string)


  The DB cluster identifier for the cluster being modified. This parameter is not case-sensitive.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster. 
   

  

``--new-db-cluster-identifier`` (string)


  The new DB cluster identifier for the DB cluster when renaming a DB cluster. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens 
   
  * The first character must be a letter 
   
  * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens 
   

   

  Example: ``my-cluster2``  

  

``--apply-immediately`` | ``--no-apply-immediately`` (boolean)


  A value that specifies whether the modifications in this request and any pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of the ``PreferredMaintenanceWindow`` setting for the DB cluster. If this parameter is set to ``false`` , changes to the DB cluster are applied during the next maintenance window.

   

  The ``ApplyImmediately`` parameter only affects the ``NewDBClusterIdentifier`` and ``MasterUserPassword`` values. If you set the ``ApplyImmediately`` parameter value to false, then changes to the ``NewDBClusterIdentifier`` and ``MasterUserPassword`` values are applied during the next maintenance window. All other changes are applied immediately, regardless of the value of the ``ApplyImmediately`` parameter.

   

  Default: ``false``  

  

``--backup-retention-period`` (integer)


  The number of days for which automated backups are retained. You must specify a minimum value of 1.

   

  Default: 1

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must be a value from 1 to 35 
   

  

``--db-cluster-parameter-group-name`` (string)


  The name of the DB cluster parameter group to use for the DB cluster.

  

``--vpc-security-group-ids`` (list)


  A list of VPC security groups that the DB cluster will belong to.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--port`` (integer)


  The port number on which the DB cluster accepts connections.

   

  Constraints: Value must be ``1150-65535``  

   

  Default: The same port as the original DB cluster.

  

``--master-user-password`` (string)


  The new password for the master database user. This password can contain any printable ASCII character except "/", """, or "@".

   

  Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 41 characters.

  

``--option-group-name`` (string)


  A value that indicates that the DB cluster should be associated with the specified option group. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage except in the following case, and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the ``ApplyImmediately`` parameter is set to ``true`` for this request. If the parameter change results in an option group that enables OEM, this change can cause a brief (sub-second) period during which new connections are rejected but existing connections are not interrupted. 

   

  Permanent options can't be removed from an option group. The option group can't be removed from a DB cluster once it is associated with a DB cluster.

  

``--preferred-backup-window`` (string)


  The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, using the ``BackupRetentionPeriod`` parameter. 

   

  The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region. 

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Must be in the format ``hh24:mi-hh24:mi`` . 
   
  * Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). 
   
  * Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window. 
   
  * Must be at least 30 minutes. 
   

  

``--preferred-maintenance-window`` (string)


  The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

   

  Format: ``ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi``  

   

  The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region, occurring on a random day of the week. 

   

  Valid Days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun.

   

  Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.

  

``--enable-iam-database-authentication`` | ``--no-enable-iam-database-authentication`` (boolean)


  True to enable mapping of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts, and otherwise false.

   

  Default: ``false``  

  

``--engine-version`` (string)


  The version number of the database engine to which you want to upgrade. Changing this parameter results in an outage. The change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the ApplyImmediately parameter is set to true.

   

  For a list of valid engine versions, see  CreateDBInstance , or call  DescribeDBEngineVersions .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

DBCluster -> (structure)

  

  Contains the details of an Amazon Neptune DB cluster. 

   

  This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClusters action. 

  

  AllocatedStorage -> (integer)

    

     ``AllocatedStorage`` always returns 1, because Neptune DB cluster storage size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as needed.

    

    

  AvailabilityZones -> (list)

    

    Provides the list of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in the DB cluster can be created in.

    

    (string)

      

      

    

  BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)

    

    Specifies the number of days for which automatic DB snapshots are retained.

    

    

  CharacterSetName -> (string)

    

    If present, specifies the name of the character set that this cluster is associated with.

    

    

  DatabaseName -> (string)

    

    Contains the name of the initial database of this DB cluster that was provided at create time, if one was specified when the DB cluster was created. This same name is returned for the life of the DB cluster.

    

    

  DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)

    

    Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

    

    

  DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)

    

    Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB cluster.

    

    

  DBSubnetGroup -> (string)

    

    Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB cluster, including the name, description, and subnets in the subnet group.

    

    

  Status -> (string)

    

    Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

    

    

  PercentProgress -> (string)

    

    Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

    

    

  EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)

    

    Specifies the earliest time to which a database can be restored with point-in-time restore.

    Specifies the connection endpoint for the primary instance of the DB cluster.

    

    

  ReaderEndpoint -> (string)

    

    The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Read Replicas that are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new connections to the reader endpoint, Neptune distributes the connection requests among the Read Replicas in the DB cluster. This functionality can help balance your read workload across multiple Read Replicas in your DB cluster. 

     

    If a failover occurs, and the Read Replica that you are connected to is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other Read Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint.

    Specifies whether the DB cluster has instances in multiple Availability Zones.

    

    

  Engine -> (string)

        * ``PENDING`` - the IAM role ARN is being associated with the DB cluster. 
         
        * ``INVALID`` - the IAM role ARN is associated with the DB cluster, but the DB cluster is unable to assume the IAM role in order to access other AWS services on your behalf.
