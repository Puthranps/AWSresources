get-reservation-coverage
************************



===========
Description
===========



Retrieves the reservation coverage for your account. This allows you to see how much of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon Relational Database Service, or Amazon Redshift usage is covered by a reservation. An organization's master account can see the coverage of the associated member accounts. For any time period, you can filter data about reservation usage by the following dimensions:

 

 
* AZ 
 
* CACHE_ENGINE 
 
* DATABASE_ENGINE 
 
* DEPLOYMENT_OPTION 
 
* INSTANCE_TYPE 
 
* LINKED_ACCOUNT 
 
* OPERATING_SYSTEM 
 
* PLATFORM 
 
* REGION 
 
* SERVICE 
 
* TAG 
 
* TENANCY 
 

 

To determine valid values for a dimension, use the ``GetDimensionValues`` operation.

=======
Options

``--time-period`` (structure)


  The start and end dates of the period for which you want to retrieve data about reservation coverage. You can retrieve data for a maximum of 13 months: the last 12 months and the current month. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if ``start`` is ``2017-01-01`` and ``end`` is ``2017-05-01`` , then the cost and usage data is retrieved from ``2017-01-01`` up to and including ``2017-04-30`` but not including ``2017-05-01`` . 

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Start=string,End=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "Start": "string",
    "End": "string"
  }



``--group-by`` (list)


  You can group the data by the following attributes:

   

   
  * AZ 
   
  * CACHE_ENGINE 
   
  * DATABASE_ENGINE 
   
  * DEPLOYMENT_OPTION 
   
  * INSTANCE_TYPE 
   
  * LINKED_ACCOUNT 
   
  * OPERATING_SYSTEM 
   
  * PLATFORM 
   
  * REGION 
   
  * TAG 
   
  * TENANCY 
   

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Type=string,Key=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Type": "DIMENSION"|"TAG",
      "Key": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--granularity`` (string)


  The granularity of the AWS cost data for the reservation. Valid values are ``MONTHLY`` and ``DAILY`` .

   

  If ``GroupBy`` is set, ``Granularity`` can't be set. If ``Granularity`` isn't set, the response object doesn't include ``Granularity`` , either ``MONTHLY`` or ``DAILY`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``DAILY``

  
  *   ``MONTHLY``

  

  

``--filter`` (structure)


  Filters utilization data by dimensions. You can filter by the following dimensions:

   

   
  * AZ 
   
  * CACHE_ENGINE 
   
  * DATABASE_ENGINE 
   
  * DEPLOYMENT_OPTION 
   
  * INSTANCE_TYPE 
   
  * LINKED_ACCOUNT 
   
  * OPERATING_SYSTEM 
   
  * PLATFORM 
   
  * REGION 
   
  * SERVICE 
   
  * TAG 
   
  * TENANCY 
   

   

   ``GetReservationCoverage`` uses the same `` `Expression <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Expression.html>`__ `` object as the other operations, but only ``AND`` is supported among each dimension. You can nest only one level deep. If there are multiple values for a dimension, they are OR'd together.

   

  If you don't provide a ``SERVICE`` filter, Cost Explorer defaults to EC2.

``--next-page-token`` (string)


  The token to retrieve the next set of results. AWS provides the token when the response from a previous call has more results than the maximum page size.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
