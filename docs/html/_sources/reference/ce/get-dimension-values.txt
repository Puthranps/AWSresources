===========
Description
===========



Retrieves all available filter values for a specified filter over a period of time. You can search the dimension values for an arbitrary string.

=======
Options

``--search-string`` (string)


  The value that you want to search the filter values for.

  

``--time-period`` (structure)


  The start and end dates for retrieving the dimension values. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if ``start`` is ``2017-01-01`` and ``end`` is ``2017-05-01`` , then the cost and usage data is retrieved from ``2017-01-01`` up to and including ``2017-04-30`` but not including ``2017-05-01`` .

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Start=string,End=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "Start": "string",
    "End": "string"
  }



``--dimension`` (string)


  The name of the dimension. Each ``Dimension`` is available for different a ``Context`` . For more information, see ``Context`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``AZ``

  
  *   ``INSTANCE_TYPE``

  
  *   ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``

  
  *   ``OPERATION``

  
  *   ``PURCHASE_TYPE``

  
  *   ``REGION``

  
  *   ``SERVICE``

  
  *   ``USAGE_TYPE``

  
  *   ``USAGE_TYPE_GROUP``

``--context`` (string)


  The context for the call to ``GetDimensionValues`` . This can be ``RESERVATIONS`` or ``COST_AND_USAGE`` . The default value is ``COST_AND_USAGE`` . If the context is set to ``RESERVATIONS`` , the resulting dimension values can be used in the ``GetReservationUtilization`` operation. If the context is set to ``COST_AND_USAGE`` the resulting dimension values can be used in the ``GetCostAndUsage`` operation.

   

  If you set the context to ``COST_AND_USAGE`` , you can use the following dimensions for searching:

   

   
  * AZ - The Availability Zone. An example is ``us-east-1a`` . 
   
  * DATABASE_ENGINE - The Amazon Relational Database Service database. Examples are Aurora or MySQL. 
   
  * INSTANCE_TYPE - The type of EC2 instance. An example is ``m4.xlarge`` . 
   
  * LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME - The name of the organization that sells you AWS services, such as Amazon Web Services. 
   
  * LINKED_ACCOUNT - The description in the attribute map that includes the full name of the member account. The value field contains the AWS ID of the member account. 
   
  * OPERATING_SYSTEM - The operating system. Examples are Windows or Linux. 
   
  * OPERATION - The action performed. Examples include ``RunInstance`` and ``CreateBucket`` . 
   
  * PLATFORM - The EC2 operating system. Examples are Windows or Linux. 
   
  * PURCHASE_TYPE - The reservation type of the purchase to which this usage is related. Examples include On-Demand Instances and Standard Reserved Instances. 
   
  * SERVICE - The AWS service such as Amazon DynamoDB. 
   
  * USAGE_TYPE - The type of usage. An example is DataTransfer-In-Bytes. The response for the ``GetDimensionValues`` operation includes a unit attribute. Examples include GB and Hrs. 
   
  * USAGE_TYPE_GROUP - The grouping of common usage types. An example is EC2: CloudWatch – Alarms. The response for this operation includes a unit attribute. 
   
  * RECORD_TYPE - The different types of charges such as RI fees, usage costs, tax refunds, and credits. 
   

   

  If you set the context to ``RESERVATIONS`` , you can use the following dimensions for searching:

   

   
  * AZ - The Availability Zone. An example is ``us-east-1a`` . 
   
  * CACHE_ENGINE - The Amazon ElastiCache operating system. Examples are Windows or Linux. 
   
  * DEPLOYMENT_OPTION - The scope of Amazon Relational Database Service deployments. Valid values are ``SingleAZ`` and ``MultiAZ`` . 
   
  * INSTANCE_TYPE - The type of EC2 instance. An example is ``m4.xlarge`` . 
   
  * LINKED_ACCOUNT - The description in the attribute map that includes the full name of the member account. The value field contains the AWS ID of the member account. 
   
  * PLATFORM - The EC2 operating system. Examples are Windows or Linux. 
   
  * REGION - The AWS Region. 
   
  * SCOPE (Utilization only) - The scope of a Reserved Instance (RI). Values are regional or a single Availability Zone. 
   
  * TAG (Coverage only) - The tags that are associated with a Reserved Instance (RI). 
   
  * TENANCY - The tenancy of a resource. Examples are shared or dedicated. 
   

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``COST_AND_USAGE``

  
  *   ``RESERVATIONS``

  

  

``--next-page-token`` (string)


  The token to retrieve the next set of results. AWS provides the token when the response from a previous call has more results than the maximum page size.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
