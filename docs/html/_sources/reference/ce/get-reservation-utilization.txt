get-reservation-utilization
***************************



===========
Description
===========



Retrieves the reservation utilization for your account. Master accounts in an organization have access to member accounts. You can filter data by dimensions in a time period. You can use ``GetDimensionValues`` to determine the possible dimension values. Currently, you can group only by ``SUBSCRIPTION_ID`` . 



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ce-2017-10-25/GetReservationUtilization>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

=======
Options
=======

``--time-period`` (structure)


  Sets the start and end dates for retrieving Reserved Instance (RI) utilization. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if ``start`` is ``2017-01-01`` and ``end`` is ``2017-05-01`` , then the cost and usage data is retrieved from ``2017-01-01`` up to and including ``2017-04-30`` but not including ``2017-05-01`` . 

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Start=string,End=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "Start": "string",
    "End": "string"
  }



``--group-by`` (list)


  Groups only by ``SUBSCRIPTION_ID`` . Metadata is included.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Type=string,Key=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Type": "DIMENSION"|"TAG",
      "Key": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--granularity`` (string)


  If ``GroupBy`` is set, ``Granularity`` can't be set. If ``Granularity`` isn't set, the response object doesn't include ``Granularity`` , either ``MONTHLY`` or ``DAILY`` . If both ``GroupBy`` and ``Granularity`` aren't set, ``GetReservationUtilization`` defaults to ``DAILY`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``DAILY``

  
  *   ``MONTHLY``

  

  

``--filter`` (structure)


  Filters utilization data by dimensions. You can filter by the following dimensions:

   

   
  * AZ 
   
  * CACHE_ENGINE 
   
  * DATABASE_ENGINE 
   
  * DEPLOYMENT_OPTION 
   
  * INSTANCE_TYPE 
   
  * LINKED_ACCOUNT 
   
  * OPERATING_SYSTEM 
   
  * PLATFORM 
   
  * REGION 
   
  * SERVICE 
   
  * SCOPE 
   
  * TENANCY 
   

   

   ``GetReservationUtilization`` uses the same `` `Expression <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Expression.html>`__ `` object as the other operations, but only ``AND`` is supported among each dimension, and nesting is supported up to only one level deep. If there are multiple values for a dimension, they are OR'd together.

``--next-page-token`` (string)


  The token to retrieve the next set of results. AWS provides the token when the response from a previous call has more results than the maximum page size.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
