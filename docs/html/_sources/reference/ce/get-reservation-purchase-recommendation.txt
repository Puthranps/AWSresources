===========
Description
===========



Gets recommendations for which reservations to purchase. These recommendations could help you reduce your costs. Reservations provide a discounted hourly rate (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing.

 

AWS generates your recommendations by identifying your On-Demand usage during a specific time period and collecting your usage into categories that are eligible for a reservation. After AWS has these categories, it simulates every combination of reservations in each category of usage to identify the best number of each type of RI to purchase to maximize your estimated savings. 

 

For example, AWS automatically aggregates your EC2 Linux, shared tenancy, and c4 family usage in the US West (Oregon) Region and recommends that you buy size-flexible regional reservations to apply to the c4 family usage. AWS recommends the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it easier to purchase a size-flexible RI. AWS also shows the equal number of normalized units so that you can purchase any instance size that you want. For this example, your RI recommendation would be for ``c4.large`` , because that is the smallest size instance in the c4 instance family.

=======
Options
=======

``--account-id`` (string)


  The account ID that is associated with the recommendation. 

  

``--service`` (string)


  The specific service that you want recommendations for.

  

``--account-scope`` (string)


  The account scope that you want recommendations for. ``PAYER`` means that AWS includes the master account and any member accounts when it calculates its recommendations. ``LINKED`` means that AWS includes only member accounts when it calculates its recommendations.

   

  Valid values are ``PAYER`` and ``LINKED`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``PAYER``

  
  *   ``LINKED``

  

  

``--lookback-period-in-days`` (string)


  The number of previous days that you want AWS to consider when it calculates your recommendations.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``SEVEN_DAYS``

  
  *   ``THIRTY_DAYS``

  
  *   ``SIXTY_DAYS``

  

  

``--term-in-years`` (string)


  The reservation term that you want recommendations for.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``ONE_YEAR``

  
  *   ``THREE_YEARS``

  

  

``--payment-option`` (string)


  The reservation purchase option that you want recommendations for.

Shorthand Syntax::

    EC2Specification={OfferingClass=string}




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "EC2Specification": {
      "OfferingClass": "STANDARD"|"CONVERTIBLE"
    }
  }



``--page-size`` (integer)


  The number of recommendations that you want returned in a single response object.

  

``--next-page-token`` (string)


  The pagination token that indicates the next set of results that you want to retrieve.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
