*****************************
put-user-permissions-boundary
*****************************



===========
Description
===========



Adds or updates the policy that is specified as the IAM user's permissions boundary. You can use an AWS managed policy or a customer managed policy to set the boundary for a user. Use the boundary to control the maximum permissions that the user can have. Setting a permissions boundary is an advanced feature that can affect the permissions for the user.

 

.. warning::

   

  Policies that are used as permissions boundaries do not provide permissions. You must also attach a permissions policy to the user. To learn how the effective permissions for a user are evaluated, see `IAM JSON Policy Evaluation Logic <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html>`__ in the IAM User Guide.

    put-user-permissions-boundary
  --user-name <value>

=======
Options
=======

``--user-name`` (string)


  The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the IAM user for which you want to set the permissions boundary.

  

``--permissions-boundary`` (string)


  The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the user.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
