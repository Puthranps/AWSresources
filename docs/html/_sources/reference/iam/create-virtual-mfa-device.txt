===========
Description
===========



Creates a new virtual MFA device for the AWS account. After creating the virtual MFA, use  EnableMFADevice to attach the MFA device to an IAM user. For more information about creating and working with virtual MFA devices, go to `Using a Virtual MFA Device <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_VirtualMFA.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

 

For information about limits on the number of MFA devices you can create, see `Limitations on Entities <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/LimitationsOnEntities.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

 

.. warning::

   

  The seed information contained in the QR code and the Base32 string should be treated like any other secret access information, such as your AWS access keys or your passwords. After you provision your virtual device, you should ensure that the information is destroyed following secure procedures.

=======
Options
=======

``--path`` (string)


  The path for the virtual MFA device. For more information about paths, see `IAM Identifiers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

   

  This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

  

``--virtual-mfa-device-name`` (string)


  The name of the virtual MFA device. Use with path to uniquely identify a virtual MFA device.

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

  

``--outfile`` (string)
The output path and file name where the bootstrap information will be stored.

``--bootstrap-method`` (string)
Method to use to seed the virtual MFA. Valid values are: QRCodePNG | Base32StringSeed


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


========
Examples
========

**To create a virtual MFA device**

This example creates a new virtual MFA device called ``BobsMFADevice``. It creates a file that contains bootstrap information called ``QRCode.png`` 
and places it in the ``C:/`` directory. The bootstrap method used in this example is ``QRCodePNG``::


  aws iam create-virtual-mfa-device --virtual-mfa-device-name BobsMFADevice --outfile C:/QRCode.png --bootstrap-method QRCodePNG

Output::

  {
      "VirtualMFADevice": {
          "SerialNumber": "arn:aws:iam::210987654321:mfa/BobsMFADevice"
  }

======
Output
======

VirtualMFADevice -> (structure)

  

  A structure containing details about the new virtual MFA device.

  

  SerialNumber -> (string)

    

    The serial number associated with ``VirtualMFADevice`` .

    

    

  Base32StringSeed -> (blob)

    

    The Base32 seed defined as specified in `RFC3548 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3548.txt>`__ . The ``Base32StringSeed`` is Base64-encoded. 

    

    

  QRCodePNG -> (blob)

    

    A QR code PNG image that encodes ``otpauth://totp/$virtualMFADeviceName@$AccountName?secret=$Base32String`` where ``$virtualMFADeviceName`` is one of the create call arguments, ``AccountName`` is the user name if set (otherwise, the account ID otherwise), and ``Base32String`` is the seed in Base32 format. The ``Base32String`` value is Base64-encoded. 

    

    

  User -> (structure)

    

    The IAM user associated with this virtual MFA device.

    

    Path -> (string)

      

      The path to the user. For more information about paths, see `IAM Identifiers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *Using IAM* guide.

      

      

    UserName -> (string)

      

      The friendly name identifying the user.

      

      

    UserId -> (string)

      

      The stable and unique string identifying the user. For more information about IDs, see `IAM Identifiers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *Using IAM* guide.

      

      

    Arn -> (string)

      

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user. For more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies, see `IAM Identifiers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *Using IAM* guide. 

      

      

    CreateDate -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user was created.

      

      

    PasswordLastUsed -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an AWS website. For a list of AWS websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential Reports <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *Using IAM* guide. If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value) then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

       

       
      * The user never had a password. 
       
      * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20th, 2014. 
       

       

      A null does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password, but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

       

      This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations. 

      

      

    PermissionsBoundary -> (structure)

      

      The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user.

       

      For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions Boundaries for IAM Identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

      

      PermissionsBoundaryType -> (string)

        

        The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of ``Policy`` .

        

        

      PermissionsBoundaryArn -> (string)

        

        The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

        

        

      

    

  EnableDate -> (timestamp)

    

    The date and time on which the virtual MFA device was enabled.
