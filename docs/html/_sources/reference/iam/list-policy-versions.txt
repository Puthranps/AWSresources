===========
Description
===========



Lists information about the versions of the specified managed policy, including the version that is currently set as the policy's default version.

 

For more information about managed policies, see `Managed Policies and Inline Policies <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``list-policy-versions`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Versions``

Options

``--policy-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy for which you want the versions.

   

  For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *AWS General Reference* .

  

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples
========

**To list information about the versions of the specified managed policy**

This example returns the list of available versions of the policy whose ARN is ``arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MySamplePolicy``::

  aws iam list-policy-versions --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MySamplePolicy 

Output::

  {
    "IsTruncated": false,
    "Versions": [
      {
        "CreateDate": "2015-06-02T23:19:44Z",
        "VersionId": "v2",
        "IsDefaultVersion": true
      },
      {
        "CreateDate": "2015-06-02T22:30:47Z",
        "VersionId": "v1",
        "IsDefaultVersion": false
      }
    ]

Output

Versions -> (list)

  

  A list of policy versions.

   

  For more information about managed policy versions, see `Versioning for Managed Policies <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

  

  (structure)

    

    Contains information about a version of a managed policy.

     

    This data type is used as a response element in the  CreatePolicyVersion ,  GetPolicyVersion ,  ListPolicyVersions , and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. 

     

    For more information about managed policies, refer to `Managed Policies and Inline Policies <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *Using IAM* guide. 

    

    Document -> (string)

      

      The policy document.

       

      The policy document is returned in the response to the  GetPolicyVersion and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. It is not returned in the response to the  CreatePolicyVersion or  ListPolicyVersions operations. 

       

      The policy document returned in this structure is URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__ . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

      

      

    VersionId -> (string)

      

      The identifier for the policy version.

       

      Policy version identifiers always begin with ``v`` (always lowercase). When a policy is created, the first policy version is ``v1`` . 

      

      

    IsDefaultVersion -> (boolean)

      

      Specifies whether the policy version is set as the policy's default version.

      

      

    CreateDate -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the policy version was created.

      

      

    

  

IsTruncated -> (boolean)

  

  A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all of your results.

  

  

Marker -> (string)

  

  When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
