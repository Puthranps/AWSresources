Options
=======

``--policy-name`` (string)


  The friendly name of the policy.

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

  

``--path`` (string)


  The path for the policy.

   

  For more information about paths, see `IAM Identifiers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

   

  This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

  

``--policy-document`` (string)


  The JSON policy document that you want to use as the content for the new policy.

   

  The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

   

   
  * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range 
   
  * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through \u00FF) 
   
  * The special characters tab (\u0009), line feed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) 
   

  

``--description`` (string)


  A friendly description of the policy.

   

  Typically used to store information about the permissions defined in the policy. For example, "Grants access to production DynamoDB tables."

   

  The policy description is immutable. After a value is assigned, it cannot be changed.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


========
Examples
========

The following command creates a customer managed policy named ``my-policy``::

  aws iam create-policy --policy-name my-policy --policy-document file://policy

Output::

  {
      "Policy": {
          "PolicyName": "my-policy",
          "CreateDate": "2015-06-01T19:31:18.620Z",
          "AttachmentCount": 0,
          "IsAttachable": true,
          "PolicyId": "ZXR6A36LTYANPAI7NJ5UV",
          "DefaultVersionId": "v1",
          "Path": "/",
          "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::0123456789012:policy/my-policy",
          "UpdateDate": "2015-06-01T19:31:18.620Z"
      }
  }

The file ``policy`` is a JSON document in the current folder that grants read only access to the ``shared`` folder in an Amazon S3 bucket named ``my-bucket``::

  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:Get*",
                  "s3:List*"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                  "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/shared/*"
              ]
          }
      ]
  }
