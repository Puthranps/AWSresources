===========
Description
===========



Updates the name and/or the path of the specified server certificate stored in IAM.

 

For more information about working with server certificates, see `Working with Server Certificates <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* . This topic also includes a list of AWS services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.

 

.. warning::

   

  You should understand the implications of changing a server certificate's path or name. For more information, see `Renaming a Server Certificate <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs_manage.html#RenamingServerCerts>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

   

 

.. note::

   

  The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the server certificate with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the certificate named ``ProductionCert`` to ``ProdCert`` , the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both certificates. If the principal has permission to update the ``ProductionCert`` group, but not the ``ProdCert`` certificate, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see `Access Management <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

Options

``--server-certificate-name`` (string)


  The name of the server certificate that you want to update.

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

  

``--new-path`` (string)


  The new path for the server certificate. Include this only if you are updating the server certificate's path.

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

  

``--new-server-certificate-name`` (string)

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
