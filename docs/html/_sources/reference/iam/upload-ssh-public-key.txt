===========
Description
===========



Uploads an SSH public key and associates it with the specified IAM user.

 

The SSH public key uploaded by this operation can be used only for authenticating the associated IAM user to an AWS CodeCommit repository. For more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an AWS CodeCommit repository, see `Set up AWS CodeCommit for SSH Connections <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-credentials-ssh.html>`__ in the *AWS CodeCommit User Guide* .

=======
Options
=======

``--user-name`` (string)


  The name of the IAM user to associate the SSH public key with.

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

  

``--ssh-public-key-body`` (string)


  The SSH public key. The public key must be encoded in ssh-rsa format or PEM format. The miminum bit-length of the public key is 2048 bits. For example, you can generate a 2048-bit key, and the resulting PEM file is 1679 bytes long.

   

  The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

   

   
  * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range 
   
  * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through \u00FF) 
   
  * The special characters tab (\u0009), line feed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) 
   

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
