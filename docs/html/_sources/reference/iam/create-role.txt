=======
Options
=======

``--path`` (string)


  The path to the role. For more information about paths, see `IAM Identifiers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

   

  This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

  

``--role-name`` (string)


  The name of the role to create.

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

   

  Role names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create roles named both "PRODROLE" and "prodrole".

  

``--assume-role-policy-document`` (string)


  The trust relationship policy document that grants an entity permission to assume the role.

   

  The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

   

   
  * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range 
   
  * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through \u00FF) 
   
  * The special characters tab (\u0009), line feed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) 
   

  

``--description`` (string)


  A description of the role.

  

``--max-session-duration`` (integer)


  The maximum session duration (in seconds) that you want to set for the specified role. If you do not specify a value for this setting, the default maximum of one hour is applied. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours.

   

  Anyone who assumes the role from the AWS CLI or API can use the ``DurationSeconds`` API parameter or the ``duration-seconds`` CLI parameter to request a longer session. The ``MaxSessionDuration`` setting determines the maximum duration that can be requested using the ``DurationSeconds`` parameter. If users don't specify a value for the ``DurationSeconds`` parameter, their security credentials are valid for one hour by default. This applies when you use the ``AssumeRole*`` API operations or the ``assume-role*`` CLI operations but does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see `Using IAM Roles <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

  

``--permissions-boundary`` (string)


  The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the role.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


========
Examples
========

**To create an IAM role**

The following ``create-role`` command creates a role named ``Test-Role`` and attaches a trust policy to it::

  aws iam create-role --role-name Test-Role --assume-role-policy-document file://Test-Role-Trust-Policy.json

Output::

  {
    "Role": {
        "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": "<URL-encoded-JSON>",
        "RoleId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
        "CreateDate": "2013-06-07T20:43:32.821Z",
        "RoleName": "Test-Role",
        "Path": "/",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/Test-Role"
    }
  }

The trust policy is defined as a JSON document in the *Test-Role-Trust-Policy.json* file. (The file name and extension do not have significance.) The trust policy must specify a principal.

To attach a permissions policy to a role, use the ``put-role-policy`` command.
