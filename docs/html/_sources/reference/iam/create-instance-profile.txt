``--instance-profile-name`` (string)


  The name of the instance profile to create.

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

  

``--path`` (string)


  The path to the instance profile. For more information about paths, see `IAM Identifiers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

   

  This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


========
Examples
========

**To create an instance profile**

The following ``create-instance-profile`` command creates an instance profile named ``Webserver``::

  aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name Webserver

Output::

  {
      "InstanceProfile": {
          "InstanceProfileId": "AIPAJMBYC7DLSPEXAMPLE",
          "Roles": [],
          "CreateDate": "2015-03-09T20:33:19.626Z",
          "InstanceProfileName": "Webserver",
          "Path": "/",
          "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:instance-profile/Webserver"
      }
  }

To add a role to an instance profile, use the ``add-role-to-instance-profile`` command.
