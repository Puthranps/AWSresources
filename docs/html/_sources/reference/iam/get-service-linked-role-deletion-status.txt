get-service-linked-role-deletion-status
***************************************



===========
Description
===========



Retrieves the status of your service-linked role deletion. After you use the  DeleteServiceLinkedRole API operation to submit a service-linked role for deletion, you can use the ``DeletionTaskId`` parameter in ``GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus`` to check the status of the deletion. If the deletion fails, this operation returns the reason that it failed, if that information is returned by the service.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis

    get-service-linked-role-deletion-status
  --deletion-task-id <value>

=======
Options
=======

``--deletion-task-id`` (string)


  The deletion task identifier. This identifier is returned by the  DeleteServiceLinkedRole operation in the format ``task/aws-service-role/<service-principal-name>/<role-name>/<task-uuid>`` .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
