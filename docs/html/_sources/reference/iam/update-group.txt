************
update-group

===========
Description
===========



Updates the name and/or the path of the specified IAM group.

 

.. warning::

   

  You should understand the implications of changing a group's path or name. For more information, see `Renaming Users and Groups <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_WorkingWithGroupsAndUsers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

   

 

.. note::

   

  The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the role group with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the group named ``Managers`` to ``MGRs`` , the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both groups. If the principal has permission to update the ``Managers`` group, but not the ``MGRs`` group, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see `Access Management <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html>`__ .

Options

``--group-name`` (string)


  Name of the IAM group to update. If you're changing the name of the group, this is the original name.

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

  

``--new-path`` (string)


  New path for the IAM group. Only include this if changing the group's path.

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

  

``--new-group-name`` (string)


  New name for the IAM group. Only include this if changing the group's name.

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
