****************************



===========
Description
===========



Adds the specified IAM role to the specified instance profile. An instance profile can contain only one role, and this limit cannot be increased. You can remove the existing role and then add a different role to an instance profile. You must then wait for the change to appear across all of AWS because of `eventual consistency <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency>`__ . To force the change, you must `disassociate the instance profile <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DisassociateIamInstanceProfile.html>`__ and then `associate the instance profile <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AssociateIamInstanceProfile.html>`__ , or you can stop your instance and then restart it.

 

.. note::

   

  The caller of this API must be granted the ``PassRole`` permission on the IAM role by a permission policy.

``--instance-profile-name`` (string)


  The name of the instance profile to update.

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
