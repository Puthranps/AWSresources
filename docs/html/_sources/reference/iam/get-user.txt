===========
Description
===========



Retrieves information about the specified IAM user, including the user's creation date, path, unique ID, and ARN.

 

If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the AWS access key ID used to sign the request to this API.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

    get-user
  [--user-name <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--user-name`` (string)


  The name of the user to get information about.

   

  This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to the user making the request. This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples

**To get information about an IAM user**

The following ``get-user`` command gets information about the IAM user named ``Bob``::

  aws iam get-user --user-name Bob

Output::

  {
      "User": {
          "UserName": "Bob",
          "Path": "/",
          "CreateDate": "2012-09-21T23:03:13Z",
          "UserId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
          "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob"
      }
  }

Output

User -> (structure)

  

  A structure containing details about the IAM user.

   

  .. warning::

     

    Due to a service issue, password last used data does not include password use from May 3rd 2018 22:50 PDT to May 23rd 2018 14:08 PDT. This affects `last sign-in <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_finding-unused.html>`__ dates shown in the IAM console and password last used dates in the `IAM credential report <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_getting-report.html>`__ , and returned by this GetUser API. If users signed in during the affected time, the password last used date that is returned is the date the user last signed in before May 3rd 2018. For users that signed in after May 23rd 2018 14:08 PDT, the returned password last used date is accurate.

     

    If you use password last used information to identify unused credentials for deletion, such as deleting users who did not sign in to AWS in the last 90 days, we recommend that you adjust your evaluation window to include dates after May 23rd 2018. Alternatively, if your users use access keys to access AWS programmatically you can refer to access key last used information because it is accurate for all dates. 

     

  

  Path -> (string)

    

    The path to the user. For more information about paths, see `IAM Identifiers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *Using IAM* guide.

    

    

  UserName -> (string)

    

    The friendly name identifying the user.

    

    

  UserId -> (string)

    

    The stable and unique string identifying the user. For more information about IDs, see `IAM Identifiers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *Using IAM* guide.

    

    

  Arn -> (string)

    

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user. For more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies, see `IAM Identifiers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *Using IAM* guide. 

    

    

  CreateDate -> (timestamp)

    

    The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user was created.

    

    

  PasswordLastUsed -> (timestamp)

    

    The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an AWS website. For a list of AWS websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential Reports <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *Using IAM* guide. If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value) then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

     

     
    * The user never had a password. 
     
    * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20th, 2014. 
     

     

    A null does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password, but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

     

    This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations. 

    

    

  PermissionsBoundary -> (structure)

    

    The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user.

     

    For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions Boundaries for IAM Identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide* .

    

    PermissionsBoundaryType -> (string)

      

      The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of ``Policy`` .

      

      

    PermissionsBoundaryArn -> (string)

      

      The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.
