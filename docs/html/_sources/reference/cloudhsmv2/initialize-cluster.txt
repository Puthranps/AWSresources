===========
Description
===========



Claims an AWS CloudHSM cluster by submitting the cluster certificate issued by your issuing certificate authority (CA) and the CA's root certificate. Before you can claim a cluster, you must sign the cluster's certificate signing request (CSR) with your issuing CA. To get the cluster's CSR, use  DescribeClusters .

=======
Options

``--cluster-id`` (string)


  The identifier (ID) of the cluster that you are claiming. To find the cluster ID, use  DescribeClusters .

  

``--signed-cert`` (string)


  The cluster certificate issued (signed) by your issuing certificate authority (CA). The certificate must be in PEM format and can contain a maximum of 5000 characters.

  

``--trust-anchor`` (string)


  The issuing certificate of the issuing certificate authority (CA) that issued (signed) the cluster certificate. This can be a root (self-signed) certificate or a certificate chain that begins with the certificate that issued the cluster certificate and ends with a root certificate. The certificate or certificate chain must be in PEM format and can contain a maximum of 5000 characters.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
