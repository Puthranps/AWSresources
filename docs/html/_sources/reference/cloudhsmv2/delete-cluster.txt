===========
Description
===========



Deletes the specified AWS CloudHSM cluster. Before you can delete a cluster, you must delete all HSMs in the cluster. To see if the cluster contains any HSMs, use  DescribeClusters . To delete an HSM, use  DeleteHsm .



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudhsmv2-2017-04-28/DeleteCluster>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

    delete-cluster
  --cluster-id <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]

=======
Options

``--cluster-id`` (string)


  The identifier (ID) of the cluster that you are deleting. To find the cluster ID, use  DescribeClusters .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
