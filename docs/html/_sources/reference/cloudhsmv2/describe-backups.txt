===========
Description
===========



Gets information about backups of AWS CloudHSM clusters.

 

This is a paginated operation, which means that each response might contain only a subset of all the backups. When the response contains only a subset of backups, it includes a ``NextToken`` value. Use this value in a subsequent ``DescribeBackups`` request to get more backups. When you receive a response with no ``NextToken`` (or an empty or null value), that means there are no more backups to get.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudhsmv2-2017-04-28/DescribeBackups>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``describe-backups`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Backups``

``--filters`` (map)


  One or more filters to limit the items returned in the response.

   

  Use the ``backupIds`` filter to return only the specified backups. Specify backups by their backup identifier (ID).

   

  Use the ``sourceBackupIds`` filter to return only the backups created from a source backup. The ``sourceBackupID`` of a source backup is returned by the  CopyBackupToRegion operation.

   

  Use the ``clusterIds`` filter to return only the backups for the specified clusters. Specify clusters by their cluster identifier (ID).

   

  Use the ``states`` filter to return only backups that match the specified state.

``--sort-ascending`` | ``--no-sort-ascending`` (boolean)


``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
