Description

Creates a new AWS CloudHSM cluster.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudhsmv2-2017-04-28/CreateCluster>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis

::

    create-cluster
  --subnet-ids <value>
  --hsm-type <value>

  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--subnet-ids`` (list)


  The identifiers (IDs) of the subnets where you are creating the cluster. You must specify at least one subnet. If you specify multiple subnets, they must meet the following criteria:

   

   
  * All subnets must be in the same virtual private cloud (VPC). 
   
  * You can specify only one subnet per Availability Zone. 
   

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--hsm-type`` (string)


  The type of HSM to use in the cluster. Currently the only allowed value is ``hsm1.medium`` .

  

``--source-backup-id`` (string)


  The identifier (ID) of the cluster backup to restore. Use this value to restore the cluster from a backup instead of creating a new cluster. To find the backup ID, use  DescribeBackups .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
