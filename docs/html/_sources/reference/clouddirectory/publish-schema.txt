``--development-schema-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with the development schema. For more information, see  arns .

  

``--minor-version`` (string)


  The minor version under which the schema will be published. This parameter is recommended. Schemas have both a major and minor version associated with them.

  

``--name`` (string)


  The new name under which the schema will be published. If this is not provided, the development schema is considered.

  

``--schema-version`` (string)


  The major version under which the schema will be published. Schemas have both a major and minor version associated with them.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
