=======
Options
=======

``--development-schema-arn`` (string)


  The ARN of the development schema with the changes used for the upgrade.

  

``--published-schema-arn`` (string)


  The ARN of the published schema to be upgraded.

  

``--minor-version`` (string)


  Identifies the minor version of the published schema that will be created. This parameter is NOT optional.

  

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Used for testing whether the Development schema provided is backwards compatible, or not, with the publish schema provided by the user to be upgraded. If schema compatibility fails, an exception would be thrown else the call would succeed. This parameter is optional and defaults to false.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
