**********************
upgrade-applied-schema
**********************



===========
Description
===========



Upgrades a single directory in-place using the ``PublishedSchemaArn`` with schema updates found in ``MinorVersion`` . Backwards-compatible minor version upgrades are instantaneously available for readers on all objects in the directory. Note: This is a synchronous API call and upgrades only one schema on a given directory per call. To upgrade multiple directories from one schema, you would need to call this API on each directory.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

    upgrade-applied-schema
  --published-schema-arn <value>

  [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--published-schema-arn`` (string)


  The revision of the published schema to upgrade the directory to.

  

``--directory-arn`` (string)


  The ARN for the directory to which the upgraded schema will be applied.

  

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Used for testing whether the major version schemas are backward compatible or not. If schema compatibility fails, an exception would be thrown else the call would succeed but no changes will be saved. This parameter is optional.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
