===========
Description
===========



Imports your signed private CA certificate into ACM PCA. Before you can call this operation, you must create the private certificate authority by calling the  CreateCertificateAuthority operation. You must then generate a certificate signing request (CSR) by calling the  GetCertificateAuthorityCsr operation. Take the CSR to your on-premises CA and use the root certificate or a subordinate certificate to sign it. Create a certificate chain and copy the signed certificate and the certificate chain to your working directory. 

 

.. note::

   

  Your certificate chain must not include the private CA certificate that you are importing.

   

 

.. note::

   

  Your on-premises CA certificate must be the last certificate in your chain. The subordinate certificate, if any, that your root CA signed must be next to last. The subordinate certificate signed by the preceding subordinate CA must come next, and so on until your chain is built. 

   

 

.. note::

   

  The chain must be PEM-encoded.

=======
Options
=======

``--certificate-authority-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was returned when you called  CreateCertificateAuthority . This must be of the form: 

   

   ``arn:aws:acm-pca:*region* :*account* :certificate-authority/*12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012* ``  

  

``--certificate`` (blob)


  The PEM-encoded certificate for your private CA. This must be signed by using your on-premises CA.

  

``--certificate-chain`` (blob)


  A PEM-encoded file that contains all of your certificates, other than the certificate you're importing, chaining up to your root CA. Your on-premises root certificate is the last in the chain, and each certificate in the chain signs the one preceding. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
