===========
Description
===========



Restores a certificate authority (CA) that is in the ``DELETED`` state. You can restore a CA during the period that you defined in the **PermanentDeletionTimeInDays** parameter of the  DeleteCertificateAuthority operation. Currently, you can specify 7 to 30 days. If you did not specify a **PermanentDeletionTimeInDays** value, by default you can restore the CA at any time in a 30 day period. You can check the time remaining in the restoration period of a private CA in the ``DELETED`` state by calling the  DescribeCertificateAuthority or  ListCertificateAuthorities operations. The status of a restored CA is set to its pre-deletion status when the **RestoreCertificateAuthority** operation returns. To change its status to ``ACTIVE`` , call the  UpdateCertificateAuthority operation. If the private CA was in the ``PENDING_CERTIFICATE`` state at deletion, you must use the  ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate operation to import a certificate authority into the private CA before it can be activated. You cannot restore a CA after the restoration period has ended.

Options
=======

``--certificate-authority-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was returned when you called the  CreateCertificateAuthority operation. This must be of the form: 

   

   ``arn:aws:acm-pca:*region* :*account* :certificate-authority/*12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012* ``  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
