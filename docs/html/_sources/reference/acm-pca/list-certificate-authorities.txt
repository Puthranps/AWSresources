===========
Description
===========



Lists the private certificate authorities that you created by using the  CreateCertificateAuthority operation.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis
========

::

    list-certificate-authorities
  [--next-token <value>]
  [--max-results <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--next-token`` (string)


  Use this parameter when paginating results in a subsequent request after you receive a response with truncated results. Set it to the value of the ``NextToken`` parameter from the response you just received.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Use this parameter when paginating results to specify the maximum number of items to return in the response on each page. If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the ``NextToken`` element is sent in the response. Use this ``NextToken`` value in a subsequent request to retrieve additional items.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

**To list your private certificate authorities**

The ``list-certificate-authorities`` command lists information about all of the private CAs in your account::

  aws acm-pca list-certificate-authorities --max-results 10

======
Output
======

CertificateAuthorities -> (list)

  

  Summary information about each certificate authority you have created.

  

  (structure)

    

    Contains information about your private certificate authority (CA). Your private CA can issue and revoke X.509 digital certificates. Digital certificates verify that the entity named in the certificate **Subject** field owns or controls the public key contained in the **Subject Public Key Info** field. Call the  CreateCertificateAuthority operation to create your private CA. You must then call the  GetCertificateAuthorityCertificate operation to retrieve a private CA certificate signing request (CSR). Take the CSR to your on-premises CA and sign it with the root CA certificate or a subordinate certificate. Call the  ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate operation to import the signed certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). 

    

    Arn -> (string)

      

      Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your private certificate authority (CA). The format is `` *12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012* `` .

        Enabled -> (boolean)

          

          Boolean value that specifies whether certificate revocation lists (CRLs) are enabled. You can use this value to enable certificate revocation for a new CA when you call the  CreateCertificateAuthority operation or for an existing CA when you call the  UpdateCertificateAuthority operation.
