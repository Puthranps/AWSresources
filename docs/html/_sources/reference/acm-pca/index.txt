===========
Description
===========



You can use the ACM PCA API to create a private certificate authority (CA). You must first call the  CreateCertificateAuthority operation. If successful, the operation returns an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your private CA. Use this ARN as input to the  GetCertificateAuthorityCsr operation to retrieve the certificate signing request (CSR) for your private CA certificate. Sign the CSR using the root or an intermediate CA in your on-premises PKI hierarchy, and call the  ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate to import your signed private CA certificate into ACM PCA. 

 

Use your private CA to issue and revoke certificates. These are private certificates that identify and secure client computers, servers, applications, services, devices, and users over SSLS/TLS connections within your organization. Call the  IssueCertificate operation to issue a certificate. Call the  RevokeCertificate operation to revoke a certificate. 

 

.. note::

   

  Certificates issued by your private CA can be trusted only within your organization, not publicly.

   

 

Your private CA can optionally create a certificate revocation list (CRL) to track the certificates you revoke. To create a CRL, you must specify a  RevocationConfiguration object when you call the  CreateCertificateAuthority operation. ACM PCA writes the CRL to an S3 bucket that you specify. You must specify a bucket policy that grants ACM PCA write permission. 

 

You can also call the  CreateCertificateAuthorityAuditReport to create an optional audit report that lists every time the CA private key is used. The private key is used for signing when the **IssueCertificate** or **RevokeCertificate** operation is called.
