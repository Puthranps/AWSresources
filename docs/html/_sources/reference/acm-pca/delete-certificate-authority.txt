****************************



===========
Description
===========



Deletes a private certificate authority (CA). You must provide the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the private CA that you want to delete. You can find the ARN by calling the  ListCertificateAuthorities operation. Before you can delete a CA, you must disable it. Call the  UpdateCertificateAuthority operation and set the **CertificateAuthorityStatus** parameter to ``DISABLED`` . 

 

Additionally, you can delete a CA if you are waiting for it to be created (the **Status** field of the  CertificateAuthority is ``CREATING`` ). You can also delete it if the CA has been created but you haven't yet imported the signed certificate (the **Status** is ``PENDING_CERTIFICATE`` ) into ACM PCA. 

 

If the CA is in one of the aforementioned states and you call  DeleteCertificateAuthority , the CA's status changes to ``DELETED`` . However, the CA won't be permentantly deleted until the restoration period has passed. By default, if you do not set the ``PermanentDeletionTimeInDays`` parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30 days. You can set the parameter from 7 to 30 days. The  DescribeCertificateAuthority operation returns the time remaining in the restoration window of a Private CA in the ``DELETED`` state. To restore an eligable CA, call the  RestoreCertificateAuthority operation.

=======
Options
=======

``--certificate-authority-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was returned when you called  CreateCertificateAuthority . This must have the following form: 

   

   ``arn:aws:acm-pca:*region* :*account* :certificate-authority/*12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012* `` . 

  

``--permanent-deletion-time-in-days`` (integer)


  The number of days to make a CA restorable after it has been deleted. This can be anywhere from 7 to 30 days, with 30 being the default.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
