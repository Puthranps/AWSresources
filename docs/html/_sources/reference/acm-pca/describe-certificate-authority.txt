===========
Description
===========



Lists information about your private certificate authority (CA). You specify the private CA on input by its ARN (Amazon Resource Name). The output contains the status of your CA. This can be any of the following: 

 

 
* ``CREATING`` - ACM PCA is creating your private certificate authority. 
 
* ``PENDING_CERTIFICATE`` - The certificate is pending. You must use your on-premises root or subordinate CA to sign your private CA CSR and then import it into PCA.  
 
* ``ACTIVE`` - Your private CA is active. 
 
* ``DISABLED`` - Your private CA has been disabled. 
 
* ``EXPIRED`` - Your private CA certificate has expired. 
 
* ``FAILED`` - Your private CA has failed. Your CA can fail because of problems such a network outage or backend AWS failure or other errors. A failed CA can never return to the pending state. You must create a new CA.  
 
* ``DELETED`` - Your private CA is within the restoration period, after which it will be permanently deleted. The length of time remaining in the CA's restoration period will also be included in this operation's output.

=======
Options
=======

``--certificate-authority-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was returned when you called  CreateCertificateAuthority . This must be of the form: 

   

   ``arn:aws:acm-pca:*region* :*account* :certificate-authority/*12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012* `` . 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

**To describe a private certificate authority**

The ``describe-certificate-authority`` command lists information about your private CA::
