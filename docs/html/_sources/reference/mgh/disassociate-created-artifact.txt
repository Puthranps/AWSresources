===========
Description
===========



Disassociates a created artifact of an AWS resource with a migration task performed by a migration tool that was previously associated. This API has the following traits:

 

 
* A migration user can call the ``DisassociateCreatedArtifacts`` operation to disassociate a created AWS Artifact from a migration task. 
 
* The created artifact name must be provided in ARN (Amazon Resource Name) format which will contain information about type and region; for example: ``arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:488216288981:image/ami-6d0ba87b`` . 
 
* Examples of the AWS resource behind the created artifact are, AMI's, EC2 instance, or RDS instance, etc.

=======
Options
=======

``--progress-update-stream`` (string)


  The name of the ProgressUpdateStream. 

  

``--migration-task-name`` (string)


  Unique identifier that references the migration task to be disassociated with the artifact.

  

``--created-artifact-name`` (string)


  An ARN of the AWS resource related to the migration (e.g., AMI, EC2 instance, RDS instance, etc.)

  

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Optional boolean flag to indicate whether any effect should take place. Used to test if the caller has permission to make the call.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
