=======
Options
=======

``--progress-update-stream`` (string)


  The name of the ProgressUpdateStream. 

  

``--migration-task-name`` (string)


  Unique identifier that references the migration task.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  If a ``NextToken`` was returned by a previous call, there are more results available. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the returned token in ``NextToken`` .

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  Maximum number of results to be returned per page.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
