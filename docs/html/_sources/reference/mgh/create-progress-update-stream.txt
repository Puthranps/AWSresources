===========
Description
===========



Creates a progress update stream which is an AWS resource used for access control as well as a namespace for migration task names that is implicitly linked to your AWS account. It must uniquely identify the migration tool as it is used for all updates made by the tool; however, it does not need to be unique for each AWS account because it is scoped to the AWS account.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

``--progress-update-stream-name`` (string)


  The name of the ProgressUpdateStream. 

  

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Optional boolean flag to indicate whether any effect should take place. Used to test if the caller has permission to make the call.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
