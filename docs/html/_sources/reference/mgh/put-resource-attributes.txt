put-resource-attributes
***********************



===========
Description
===========



Provides identifying details of the resource being migrated so that it can be associated in the Application Discovery Service (ADS)'s repository. This association occurs asynchronously after ``PutResourceAttributes`` returns.

 

.. warning::

   

   
  * Keep in mind that subsequent calls to PutResourceAttributes will override previously stored attributes. For example, if it is first called with a MAC address, but later, it is desired to *add* an IP address, it will then be required to call it with *both* the IP and MAC addresses to prevent overiding the MAC address. 
   
  * Note the instructions regarding the special use case of the ` ``ResourceAttributeList`` https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/API_PutResourceAttributes.html#migrationhub-PutResourceAttributes-request-ResourceAttributeList`__ parameter when specifying any "VM" related value.  
   

   

 

.. note::

   

  Because this is an asynchronous call, it will always return 200, whether an association occurs or not. To confirm if an association was found based on the provided details, call ``ListDiscoveredResources`` .

=======
Options
=======

``--progress-update-stream`` (string)


  The name of the ProgressUpdateStream. 

  

``--migration-task-name`` (string)


  Unique identifier that references the migration task.

  

``--resource-attribute-list`` (list)


  Information about the resource that is being migrated. This data will be used to map the task to a resource in the Application Discovery Service (ADS)'s repository.

   

  .. note::

     

    Takes the object array of ``ResourceAttribute`` where the ``Type`` field is reserved for the following values: ``IPV4_ADDRESS | IPV6_ADDRESS | MAC_ADDRESS | FQDN | VM_MANAGER_ID | VM_MANAGED_OBJECT_REFERENCE | VM_NAME | VM_PATH | BIOS_ID | MOTHERBOARD_SERIAL_NUMBER`` where the identifying value can be a string up to 256 characters.

     

   

  .. warning::

     

     
    * If any "VM" related value is set for a ``ResourceAttribute`` object, it is required that ``VM_MANAGER_ID`` , as a minimum, is always set. If ``VM_MANAGER_ID`` is not set, then all "VM" fields will be discarded and "VM" fields will not be used for matching the migration task to a server in Application Discovery Service (ADS)'s repository. See the `Example <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/API_PutResourceAttributes.html#API_PutResourceAttributes_Examples>`__ section below for a use case of specifying "VM" related values. 
     
    * If a server you are trying to match has multiple IP or MAC addresses, you should provide as many as you know in separate type/value pairs passed to the ``ResourceAttributeList`` parameter to maximize the chances of matching. 
     

     

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Type=string,Value=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Type": "IPV4_ADDRESS"|"IPV6_ADDRESS"|"MAC_ADDRESS"|"FQDN"|"VM_MANAGER_ID"|"VM_MANAGED_OBJECT_REFERENCE"|"VM_NAME"|"VM_PATH"|"BIOS_ID"|"MOTHERBOARD_SERIAL_NUMBER",
      "Value": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Optional boolean flag to indicate whether any effect should take place. Used to test if the caller has permission to make the call.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
