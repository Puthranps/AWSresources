*****************************



===========
Description
===========



Deletes a progress update stream, including all of its tasks, which was previously created as an AWS resource used for access control. This API has the following traits:

 

 
* The only parameter needed for ``DeleteProgressUpdateStream`` is the stream name (same as a ``CreateProgressUpdateStream`` call). 
 
* The call will return, and a background process will asynchronously delete the stream and all of its resources (tasks, associated resources, resource attributes, created artifacts). 
 
* If the stream takes time to be deleted, it might still show up on a ``ListProgressUpdateStreams`` call. 
 
* ``CreateProgressUpdateStream`` , ``ImportMigrationTask`` , ``NotifyMigrationTaskState`` , and all Associate[*] APIs realted to the tasks belonging to the stream will throw "InvalidInputException" if the stream of the same name is in the process of being deleted. 
 
* Once the stream and all of its resources are deleted, ``CreateProgressUpdateStream`` for a stream of the same name will succeed, and that stream will be an entirely new logical resource (without any resources associated with the old stream).

Options

``--progress-update-stream-name`` (string)


  The name of the ProgressUpdateStream. 

  

``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Optional boolean flag to indicate whether any effect should take place. Used to test if the caller has permission to make the call.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
