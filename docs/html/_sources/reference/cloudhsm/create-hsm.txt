 **For information about the current version of AWS CloudHSM** , see `AWS CloudHSM <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/>`__ , the `AWS CloudHSM User Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/>`__ , and the `AWS CloudHSM API Reference <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/>`__ .

 

Creates an uninitialized HSM instance.

 

There is an upfront fee charged for each HSM instance that you create with the ``CreateHsm`` operation. If you accidentally provision an HSM and want to request a refund, delete the instance using the  DeleteHsm operation, go to the `AWS Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ , create a new case, and select **Account and Billing Support** .

 

.. warning::

   

  It can take up to 20 minutes to create and provision an HSM. You can monitor the status of the HSM with the  DescribeHsm operation. The HSM is ready to be initialized when the status changes to ``RUNNING`` .

=======
Options
=======

``--subnet-id`` (string)


  The identifier of the subnet in your VPC in which to place the HSM.

  

``--ssh-key`` (string)


  The SSH public key to install on the HSM.

  

``--eni-ip`` (string)


  The IP address to assign to the HSM's ENI.

   

  If an IP address is not specified, an IP address will be randomly chosen from the CIDR range of the subnet.

  

``--iam-role-arn`` (string)


  The ARN of an IAM role to enable the AWS CloudHSM service to allocate an ENI on your behalf.

  

``--external-id`` (string)


  The external ID from ``IamRoleArn`` , if present.

  

``--subscription-type`` (string)


  Specifies the type of subscription for the HSM.

   

   
  * **PRODUCTION** - The HSM is being used in a production environment. 
   
  * **TRIAL** - The HSM is being used in a product trial. 
   

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``PRODUCTION``

  

  

``--client-token`` (string)


  A user-defined token to ensure idempotence. Subsequent calls to this operation with the same token will be ignored.

  

``--syslog-ip`` (string)


  The IP address for the syslog monitoring server. The AWS CloudHSM service only supports one syslog monitoring server.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
