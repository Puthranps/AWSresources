Description
===========



Lists the associations between your Direct Connect gateways and virtual private gateways. You must specify a Direct Connect gateway, a virtual private gateway, or both. If you specify a Direct Connect gateway, the response contains all virtual private gateways associated with the Direct Connect gateway. If you specify a virtual private gateway, the response contains all Direct Connect gateways associated with the virtual private gateway. If you specify both, the response contains the association between the Direct Connect gateway and the virtual private gateway.

=======
Options
=======

``--direct-connect-gateway-id`` (string)


  The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.

  

``--virtual-gateway-id`` (string)


  The ID of the virtual private gateway.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of associations to return per page.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token provided in the previous call to retrieve the next page.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
