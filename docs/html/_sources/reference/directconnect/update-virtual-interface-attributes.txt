***********************************



===========
Description
===========



Updates the specified attributes of the specified virtual private interface.

 

Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds. To check whether your connection supports jumbo frames, call  DescribeConnections . To check whether your virtual interface supports jumbo frames, call  DescribeVirtualInterfaces .

::

    update-virtual-interface-attributes
  --virtual-interface-id <value>
  [--mtu <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--virtual-interface-id`` (string)


  The ID of the virtual private interface.

  

``--mtu`` (integer)


  The maximum transmission unit (MTU), in bytes. The supported values are 1500 and 9001. The default value is 1500.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

virtualInterfaceId -> (string)

  

  The ID of the virtual interface.

  

  

location -> (string)

  

  The location of the connection.

  

  

connectionId -> (string)

  

  The ID of the connection.

  

  

virtualInterfaceType -> (string)

  

  The type of virtual interface. The possible values are ``private`` and ``public`` .

  

  

virtualInterfaceName -> (string)

  

  The name of the virtual interface assigned by the customer network.

  

  

vlan -> (integer)

  

  The ID of the VLAN.

  

  

asn -> (integer)

  

  The autonomous system (AS) number for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configuration.

  

  

amazonSideAsn -> (long)

  

  The autonomous system number (ASN) for the Amazon side of the connection.

  

  

authKey -> (string)

  

  The authentication key for BGP configuration.

  

  

amazonAddress -> (string)

  

  The IP address assigned to the Amazon interface.

  

  

customerAddress -> (string)

  

  The IP address assigned to the customer interface.

  

  

addressFamily -> (string)

  

  The address family for the BGP peer.

  

  

virtualInterfaceState -> (string)

  

  The state of the virtual interface. The following are the possible values:

   

   
  * ``confirming`` : The creation of the virtual interface is pending confirmation from the virtual interface owner. If the owner of the virtual interface is different from the owner of the connection on which it is provisioned, then the virtual interface will remain in this state until it is confirmed by the virtual interface owner. 
   
  * ``verifying`` : This state only applies to public virtual interfaces. Each public virtual interface needs validation before the virtual interface can be created. 
   
  * ``pending`` : A virtual interface is in this state from the time that it is created until the virtual interface is ready to forward traffic. 
   
  * ``available`` : A virtual interface that is able to forward traffic. 
   
  * ``down`` : A virtual interface that is BGP down. 
   
  * ``deleting`` : A virtual interface is in this state immediately after calling  DeleteVirtualInterface until it can no longer forward traffic. 
   
  * ``deleted`` : A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic. 
   
  * ``rejected`` : The virtual interface owner has declined creation of the virtual interface. If a virtual interface in the ``Confirming`` state is deleted by the virtual interface owner, the virtual interface enters the ``Rejected`` state. 
   

  

  

customerRouterConfig -> (string)

  

  The customer router configuration.

  

  

mtu -> (integer)

  

  The maximum transmission unit (MTU), in bytes. The supported values are 1500 and 9001. The default value is 1500.

  

  

jumboFrameCapable -> (boolean)

  

  Indicates whether jumbo frames (9001 MTU) are supported.

      The state of the BGP peer. The following are the possible values:
