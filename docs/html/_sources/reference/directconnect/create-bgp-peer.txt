===========
Description
===========



Creates a BGP peer on the specified virtual interface.

 

The BGP peer cannot be in the same address family (IPv4/IPv6) of an existing BGP peer on the virtual interface.

 

You must create a BGP peer for the corresponding address family in order to access AWS resources that also use that address family.

 

When creating a IPv6 BGP peer, omit the Amazon address and customer address. IPv6 addresses are automatically assigned from the Amazon pool of IPv6 addresses; you cannot specify custom IPv6 addresses.

 

For a public virtual interface, the Autonomous System Number (ASN) must be private or already whitelisted for the virtual interface.

=======
Options
=======

``--virtual-interface-id`` (string)


  The ID of the virtual interface.

  

``--new-bgp-peer`` (structure)


  Information about the BGP peer.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    asn=integer,authKey=string,addressFamily=string,amazonAddress=string,customerAddress=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "asn": integer,
    "authKey": "string",
    "addressFamily": "ipv4"|"ipv6",
    "amazonAddress": "string",
    "customerAddress": "string"
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

**To create an IPv6 BGP peering session**

The following example creates an IPv6 BGP peering session on private virtual interface ``dxvif-fg1vuj3d``. The peer IPv6 addresses are automatically allocated by Amazon.

Command::

  aws directconnect create-bgp-peer --virtual-interface-id dxvif-fg1vuj3d --new-bgp-peer asn=64600,addressFamily=ipv6
