===========
Description
===========



Creates a link aggregation group (LAG) with the specified number of bundled physical connections between the customer network and a specific AWS Direct Connect location. A LAG is a logical interface that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to aggregate multiple interfaces, enabling you to treat them as a single interface.

 

All connections in a LAG must use the same bandwidth and must terminate at the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint.

 

You can have up to 10 connections per LAG. Regardless of this limit, if you request more connections for the LAG than AWS Direct Connect can allocate on a single endpoint, no LAG is created.

 

You can specify an existing physical connection or interconnect to include in the LAG (which counts towards the total number of connections). Doing so interrupts the current physical connection or hosted connections, and re-establishes them as a member of the LAG. The LAG will be created on the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint to which the connection terminates. Any virtual interfaces associated with the connection are automatically disassociated and re-associated with the LAG. The connection ID does not change.

 

If the AWS account used to create a LAG is a registered AWS Direct Connect partner, the LAG is automatically enabled to host sub-connections. For a LAG owned by a partner, any associated virtual interfaces cannot be directly configured.

=======
Options
=======

``--number-of-connections`` (integer)


  The number of physical connections initially provisioned and bundled by the LAG.

  

``--location`` (string)


  The location for the LAG.

  

``--connections-bandwidth`` (string)


  The bandwidth of the individual physical connections bundled by the LAG. The possible values are 1Gbps and 10Gbps.

  

``--lag-name`` (string)


  The name of the LAG.

  

``--connection-id`` (string)


  The ID of an existing connection to migrate to the LAG.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

**To create a LAG with new connections**

The following example creates a LAG and requests two new AWS Direct Connect connections for the LAG with a bandwidth of 1 Gbps.

Command::

  aws directconnect create-lag --location CSVA1 --number-of-connections 2 --connections-bandwidth 1Gbps --lag-name 1GBLag

Output::

**To create a LAG using an existing connection**

The following example creates a LAG from an existing connection in your account, and requests a second new connection for the LAG with the same bandwidth and location as the existing connection. 

Command::

  aws directconnect create-lag --location EqDC2 --number-of-connections 2 --connections-bandwidth 1Gbps --lag-name 2ConnLAG --connection-id dxcon-fgk145dr
