Synopsis

::

    describe-connections-on-interconnect
  --interconnect-id <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--interconnect-id`` (string)


  The ID of the interconnect.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples

**To list connections on an interconnect**

The following ``describe-connections-on-interconnect`` command lists connections that have been provisioned on the given interconnect::

  aws directconnect describe-connections-on-interconnect --interconnect-id dxcon-fgktov66

Output::

  {
      "connections": [
          {
              "partnerName": "TIVIT", 
              "vlan": 101, 
              "ownerAccount": "123456789012",
