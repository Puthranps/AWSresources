Description

Gets the LOA-CFA for a connection, interconnect, or link aggregation group (LAG).

 

The Letter of Authorization - Connecting Facility Assignment (LOA-CFA) is a document that is used when establishing your cross connect to AWS at the colocation facility. For more information, see `Requesting Cross Connects at AWS Direct Connect Locations <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/Colocation.html>`__ in the *AWS Direct Connect User Guide* .

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis

::

    describe-loa
  --connection-id <value>

=======
Options
=======

``--connection-id`` (string)


  The ID of a connection, LAG, or interconnect.

  

``--provider-name`` (string)


  The name of the service provider who establishes connectivity on your behalf. If you specify this parameter, the LOA-CFA lists the provider name alongside your company name as the requester of the cross connect.

  

``--loa-content-type`` (string)


  The standard media type for the LOA-CFA document. The only supported value is application/pdf.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``application/pdf``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Examples
========

**To describe your LOA-CFA for a connection using Linux or Mac OS X**

The following example describes your LOA-CFA for connection ``dxcon-fh6ayh1d``. The contents of the LOA-CFA are base64-encoded. This command uses the ``--output`` and ``--query`` parameters to control the output and extract the contents of the ``loaContent`` structure. The final part of the command decodes the content using the ``base64`` utility, and sends the output to a PDF file.

.. code::

  aws directconnect describe-loa --connection-id dxcon-fh6ayh1d --output text --query loa.loaContent|base64 --decode > myLoaCfa.pdf

**To describe your LOA-CFA for a connection using Windows**

The previous example requires the use of the ``base64`` utility to decode the output. On a Windows computer, you can use ``certutil`` instead. In the following example, the first command describes your LOA-CFA for connection ``dxcon-fh6ayh1d`` and uses the ``--output`` and ``--query`` parameters to control the output and extract the contents of the ``loaContent`` structure to a file called ``myLoaCfa.base64``. The second command uses the ``certutil`` utility to decode the file and send the output to a PDF file.

.. code::

  aws directconnect describe-loa --connection-id dxcon-fh6ayh1d --output text --query loa.loaContent > myLoaCfa.base64 

.. code::

  certutil -decode myLoaCfa.base64 myLoaCfa.pdf
