    confirm-connection

Options

``--connection-id`` (string)


  The ID of the hosted connection.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

  The state of the connection. The following are the possible values:

  * ``pending`` : The connection has been approved and is being initialized. 
   
  * ``available`` : The network link is up and the connection is ready for use. 
   
  * ``down`` : The network link is down. 
   
  * ``deleting`` : The connection is being deleted. 
   
  * ``deleted`` : The connection has been deleted. 
   
  * ``rejected`` : A hosted connection in the ``ordering`` state enters the ``rejected`` state if it is deleted by the customer.
