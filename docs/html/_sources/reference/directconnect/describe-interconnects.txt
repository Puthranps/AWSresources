Description
===========



Lists the interconnects owned by the AWS account or only the specified interconnect.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis

::

    describe-interconnects
  [--interconnect-id <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--interconnect-id`` (string)


  The ID of the interconnect.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

**To list interconnects**

The following ``describe-interconnects`` command lists the interconnects owned by your AWS account::

  aws directconnect describe-interconnects

Output::

  {
      "interconnects": [
          {
              "region": "sa-east-1", 
              "bandwidth": "1Gbps", 
              "location": "TIVIT", 
              "interconnectName": "1G Interconnect to AWS", 
              "interconnectId": "dxcon-fgktov66",
