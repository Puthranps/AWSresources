associate-virtual-interface
***************************



===========
Description
===========



Associates a virtual interface with a specified link aggregation group (LAG) or connection. Connectivity to AWS is temporarily interrupted as the virtual interface is being migrated. If the target connection or LAG has an associated virtual interface with a conflicting VLAN number or a conflicting IP address, the operation fails.

 

Virtual interfaces associated with a hosted connection cannot be associated with a LAG; hosted connections must be migrated along with their virtual interfaces using  AssociateHostedConnection .

 

To reassociate a virtual interface to a new connection or LAG, the requester must own either the virtual interface itself or the connection to which the virtual interface is currently associated. Additionally, the requester must own the connection or LAG for the association.

Synopsis

::

    associate-virtual-interface
  --virtual-interface-id <value>
  --connection-id <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--virtual-interface-id`` (string)


  The ID of the virtual interface.

  

``--connection-id`` (string)


  The ID of the LAG or connection.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Examples
========

**To associate a virtual interface with a connection**

The following example associates the specified virtual interface with the specified LAG. Alternatively, to associate the virtual interface with a connection, specify the ID of an AWS Direct Connect connection for ``--connection-id``; for example, ``dxcon-ffnikghc``.

Command::

  aws directconnect associate-virtual-interface --connection-id dxlag-ffjhj9lx --virtual-interface-id dxvif-fgputw0j

ownerAccount -> (string)

  

  The ID of the AWS account that owns the virtual interface.

  

  

virtualInterfaceId -> (string)

  

  The ID of the virtual interface.

  The location of the connection.

  The ID of the connection.

  The name of the virtual interface assigned by the customer network.

  

  

vlan -> (integer)

  

  The ID of the VLAN.

  

  

asn -> (integer)

  

  The autonomous system (AS) number for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configuration.

  

  

amazonSideAsn -> (long)

  

  The autonomous system number (ASN) for the Amazon side of the connection.

  The state of the virtual interface. The following are the possible values:

   

   
  * ``confirming`` : The creation of the virtual interface is pending confirmation from the virtual interface owner. If the owner of the virtual interface is different from the owner of the connection on which it is provisioned, then the virtual interface will remain in this state until it is confirmed by the virtual interface owner. 
   
  * ``verifying`` : This state only applies to public virtual interfaces. Each public virtual interface needs validation before the virtual interface can be created. 
   
  * ``pending`` : A virtual interface is in this state from the time that it is created until the virtual interface is ready to forward traffic. 
   
  * ``available`` : A virtual interface that is able to forward traffic. 
   
  * ``down`` : A virtual interface that is BGP down. 
   
  * ``deleting`` : A virtual interface is in this state immediately after calling  DeleteVirtualInterface until it can no longer forward traffic. 
   
  * ``deleted`` : A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic. 
   
  * ``rejected`` : The virtual interface owner has declined creation of the virtual interface. If a virtual interface in the ``Confirming`` state is deleted by the virtual interface owner, the virtual interface enters the ``Rejected`` state.
