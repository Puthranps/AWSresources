===========
Description
===========



Provisions a public virtual interface to be owned by the specified AWS account.

 

The owner of a connection calls this function to provision a public virtual interface to be owned by the specified AWS account.

 

Virtual interfaces created using this function must be confirmed by the owner using  ConfirmPublicVirtualInterface . Until this step has been completed, the virtual interface is in the ``confirming`` state and is not available to handle traffic.

 

When creating an IPv6 public virtual interface, omit the Amazon address and customer address. IPv6 addresses are automatically assigned from the Amazon pool of IPv6 addresses; you cannot specify custom IPv6 addresses.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

**To provision a public virtual interface**

The following ``allocate-public-virtual-interface`` command provisions a public virtual interface to be owned by a different customer::

  aws directconnect allocate-public-virtual-interface --connection-id dxcon-ffjrkx17 --owner-account 123456789012 --new-public-virtual-interface-allocation virtualInterfaceName=PublicVirtualInterface,vlan=2000,asn=65000,authKey=asdf34example,amazonAddress=203.0.113.1/30,customerAddress=203.0.113.2/30,routeFilterPrefixes=[{cidr=203.0.113.0/30},{cidr=203.0.113.4/30}]

virtualInterfaceName -> (string)

  

  The name of the virtual interface assigned by the customer network.

  The ID of the VLAN.

  

  

asn -> (integer)

  

  The autonomous system (AS) number for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configuration.

  

  

amazonSideAsn -> (long)

  

  The autonomous system number (ASN) for the Amazon side of the connection.

virtualInterfaceState -> (string)

  

  The state of the virtual interface. The following are the possible values:

   

   
  * ``confirming`` : The creation of the virtual interface is pending confirmation from the virtual interface owner. If the owner of the virtual interface is different from the owner of the connection on which it is provisioned, then the virtual interface will remain in this state until it is confirmed by the virtual interface owner. 
   
  * ``verifying`` : This state only applies to public virtual interfaces. Each public virtual interface needs validation before the virtual interface can be created. 
   
  * ``pending`` : A virtual interface is in this state from the time that it is created until the virtual interface is ready to forward traffic. 
   
  * ``available`` : A virtual interface that is able to forward traffic. 
   
  * ``down`` : A virtual interface that is BGP down. 
   
  * ``deleting`` : A virtual interface is in this state immediately after calling  DeleteVirtualInterface until it can no longer forward traffic. 
   
  * ``deleted`` : A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic. 
   
  * ``rejected`` : The virtual interface owner has declined creation of the virtual interface. If a virtual interface in the ``Confirming`` state is deleted by the virtual interface owner, the virtual interface enters the ``Rejected`` state.
