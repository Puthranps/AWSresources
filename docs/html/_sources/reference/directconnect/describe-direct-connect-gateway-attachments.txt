===========
Description
===========



Lists the attachments between your Direct Connect gateways and virtual interfaces. You must specify a Direct Connect gateway, a virtual interface, or both. If you specify a Direct Connect gateway, the response contains all virtual interfaces attached to the Direct Connect gateway. If you specify a virtual interface, the response contains all Direct Connect gateways attached to the virtual interface. If you specify both, the response contains the attachment between the Direct Connect gateway and the virtual interface.

=======
Options
=======

``--direct-connect-gateway-id`` (string)


  The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.

  

``--virtual-interface-id`` (string)


  The ID of the virtual interface.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of attachments to return per page.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  The token provided in the previous call to retrieve the next page.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
