===========
Description
===========



Creates a Direct Connect gateway, which is an intermediate object that enables you to connect a set of virtual interfaces and virtual private gateways. A Direct Connect gateway is global and visible in any AWS Region after it is created. The virtual interfaces and virtual private gateways that are connected through a Direct Connect gateway can be in different AWS Regions. This enables you to connect to a VPC in any Region, regardless of the Region in which the virtual interfaces are located, and pass traffic between them.

Synopsis

::

    create-direct-connect-gateway
  --direct-connect-gateway-name <value>
  [--amazon-side-asn <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--direct-connect-gateway-name`` (string)


  The name of the Direct Connect gateway.

  

``--amazon-side-asn`` (long)


  The autonomous system number (ASN) for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to be configured on the Amazon side of the connection. The ASN must be in the private range of 64,512 to 65,534 or 4,200,000,000 to 4,294,967,294. The default is 64512.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

        "ownerAccount": "123456789012", 
        "directConnectGatewayName": "DxGateway1", 
        "directConnectGatewayState": "available"
    }
  }
