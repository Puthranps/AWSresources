*****************
create-connection
*****************



===========
Description
===========



Creates a connection between a customer network and a specific AWS Direct Connect location.

 

A connection links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router.

 

To find the locations for your Region, use  DescribeLocations .

 

You can automatically add the new connection to a link aggregation group (LAG) by specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that the new connection is allocated on the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint that hosts the specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the endpoint, the request fails and no connection is created.

=======
Options
=======

``--location`` (string)


  The location of the connection.

  

``--bandwidth`` (string)


  The bandwidth of the connection.

  

``--connection-name`` (string)


  The name of the connection.

  

``--lag-id`` (string)


  The ID of the LAG.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Examples
========

**To create a connection from your network to an AWS Direct Connect location**

The following ``create-connection`` command creates a connection from your network to an AWS Direct Connect location::

  aws directconnect create-connection --location TIVIT --bandwidth 1Gbps --connection-name "Connection to AWS"

Output::

  {
      "ownerAccount": "123456789012", 
      "connectionId": "dxcon-fg31dyv6", 
      "connectionState": "requested", 
      "bandwidth": "1Gbps", 
      "location": "TIVIT", 
      "connectionName": "Connection to AWS", 
      "region": "sa-east-1"
  }

======
Output
======

ownerAccount -> (string)

  

  The ID of the AWS account that owns the connection.

  

  

connectionId -> (string)

  

  The ID of the connection.

  

  

connectionName -> (string)

  

  The name of the connection.

  

  

connectionState -> (string)

  

  The state of the connection. The following are the possible values:

   

   
  * ``ordering`` : The initial state of a hosted connection provisioned on an interconnect. The connection stays in the ordering state until the owner of the hosted connection confirms or declines the connection order. 
   
  * ``requested`` : The initial state of a standard connection. The connection stays in the requested state until the Letter of Authorization (LOA) is sent to the customer. 
   
  * ``pending`` : The connection has been approved and is being initialized. 
   
  * ``available`` : The network link is up and the connection is ready for use. 
   
  * ``down`` : The network link is down. 
   
  * ``deleting`` : The connection is being deleted. 
   
  * ``deleted`` : The connection has been deleted. 
   
  * ``rejected`` : A hosted connection in the ``ordering`` state enters the ``rejected`` state if it is deleted by the customer. 
   

  

  

region -> (string)
