Options

``--name`` (string)


  The name of the group, which is the identifier of the group in other operations. A resource group name cannot be updated after it is created. A resource group name can have a maximum of 128 characters, including letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores. The name cannot start with ``AWS`` or ``aws`` ; these are reserved. A resource group name must be unique within your account.

  

``--description`` (string)


  The description of the resource group. Descriptions can have a maximum of 511 characters, including letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, punctuation, and spaces.

  

``--resource-query`` (structure)


  The resource query that determines which AWS resources are members of this group.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Type=string,Query=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0",
    "Query": "string"
  }



``--tags`` (map)


  The tags to add to the group. A tag is a string-to-string map of key-value pairs. Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string




JSON Syntax::

  {"string": "string"
    ...}



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
