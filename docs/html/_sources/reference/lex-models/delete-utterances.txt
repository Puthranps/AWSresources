===========
Description
===========



Deletes stored utterances.

 

Amazon Lex stores the utterances that users send to your bot. Utterances are stored for 15 days for use with the  GetUtterancesView operation, and then stored indefinitely for use in improving the ability of your bot to respond to user input.

 

Use the ``DeleteStoredUtterances`` operation to manually delete stored utterances for a specific user.

 

This operation requires permissions for the ``lex:DeleteUtterances`` action.

Options

``--bot-name`` (string)


  The name of the bot that stored the utterances.

  

``--user-id`` (string)


  The unique identifier for the user that made the utterances. This is the user ID that was sent in the `PostContent <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/API_runtime_PostContent.html>`__ or `PostText <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/API_runtime_PostText.html>`__ operation request that contained the utterance.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
