Synopsis

::

    start-import
  --payload <value>
  --resource-type <value>
  --merge-strategy <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--payload`` (blob)


  A zip archive in binary format. The archive should contain one file, a JSON file containing the resource to import. The resource should match the type specified in the ``resourceType`` field.

  

``--resource-type`` (string)


  Specifies the type of resource to export. Each resource also exports any resources that it depends on. 

   

   
  * A bot exports dependent intents. 
   
  * An intent exports dependent slot types. 
   

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``BOT``

  
  *   ``INTENT``

  
  *   ``SLOT_TYPE``

  

  

``--merge-strategy`` (string)


  Specifies the action that the ``StartImport`` operation should take when there is an existing resource with the same name.

   

   
  * FAIL_ON_CONFLICT - The import operation is stopped on the first conflict between a resource in the import file and an existing resource. The name of the resource causing the conflict is in the ``failureReason`` field of the response to the ``GetImport`` operation. OVERWRITE_LATEST - The import operation proceeds even if there is a conflict with an existing resource. The $LASTEST version of the existing resource is overwritten with the data from the import file. 
   

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``OVERWRITE_LATEST``

  
  *   ``FAIL_ON_CONFLICT``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
