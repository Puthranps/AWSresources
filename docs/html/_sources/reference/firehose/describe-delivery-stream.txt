===========
Description
===========



Describes the specified delivery stream and gets the status. For example, after your delivery stream is created, call ``DescribeDeliveryStream`` to see whether the delivery stream is ``ACTIVE`` and therefore ready for data to be sent to it.

=======
Options
=======

``--delivery-stream-name`` (string)


  The name of the delivery stream.

  

``--limit`` (integer)


  The limit on the number of destinations to return. You can have one destination per delivery stream.

  

``--exclusive-start-destination-id`` (string)


  The ID of the destination to start returning the destination information. Kinesis Data Firehose supports one destination per delivery stream.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              Specifies the table version for the output data schema. If you don't specify this version ID, or if you set it to ``LATEST`` , Kinesis Data Firehose uses the most recent version. This means that any updates to the table are automatically picked up.

              

              

            

          InputFormatConfiguration -> (structure)

            

            Specifies the deserializer that you want Kinesis Data Firehose to use to convert the format of your data from JSON.

            

            Deserializer -> (structure)

              

              Specifies which deserializer to use. You can choose either the Apache Hive JSON SerDe or the OpenX JSON SerDe. If both are non-null, the server rejects the request.

              

              OpenXJsonSerDe -> (structure)

                

                The OpenX SerDe. Used by Kinesis Data Firehose for deserializing data, which means converting it from the JSON format in preparation for serializing it to the Parquet or ORC format. This is one of two deserializers you can choose, depending on which one offers the functionality you need. The other option is the native Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe.

                

                ConvertDotsInJsonKeysToUnderscores -> (boolean)

                  

                  When set to ``true`` , specifies that the names of the keys include dots and that you want Kinesis Data Firehose to replace them with underscores. This is useful because Apache Hive does not allow dots in column names. For example, if the JSON contains a key whose name is "a.b", you can define the column name to be "a_b" when using this option.

                   

                  The default is ``false`` .

                  

                  

                CaseInsensitive -> (boolean)

                  

                  When set to ``true`` , which is the default, Kinesis Data Firehose converts JSON keys to lowercase before deserializing them.

                  

                  

                ColumnToJsonKeyMappings -> (map)

                  

                  Maps column names to JSON keys that aren't identical to the column names. This is useful when the JSON contains keys that are Hive keywords. For example, ``timestamp`` is a Hive keyword. If you have a JSON key named ``timestamp`` , set this parameter to ``{"ts": "timestamp"}`` to map this key to a column named ``ts`` .

                  

                  key -> (string)

                    

                    

                  value -> (string)

                    

                    

                  

                

              HiveJsonSerDe -> (structure)

                

                The native Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe. Used by Kinesis Data Firehose for deserializing data, which means converting it from the JSON format in preparation for serializing it to the Parquet or ORC format. This is one of two deserializers you can choose, depending on which one offers the functionality you need. The other option is the OpenX SerDe.

                

                TimestampFormats -> (list)

                  

                  Indicates how you want Kinesis Data Firehose to parse the date and time stamps that may be present in your input data JSON. To specify these format strings, follow the pattern syntax of JodaTime's DateTimeFormat format strings. For more information, see `Class DateTimeFormat <https://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormat.html>`__ . You can also use the special value ``millis`` to parse time stamps in epoch milliseconds. If you don't specify a format, Kinesis Data Firehose uses ``java.sql.Timestamp::valueOf`` by default.

                  

                  (string)

                    

                    

                  

                

              

            

          OutputFormatConfiguration -> (structure)

            

            Specifies the serializer that you want Kinesis Data Firehose to use to convert the format of your data to the Parquet or ORC format.

            

            Serializer -> (structure)

              

              Specifies which serializer to use. You can choose either the ORC SerDe or the Parquet SerDe. If both are non-null, the server rejects the request.

              

              ParquetSerDe -> (structure)

                

                A serializer to use for converting data to the Parquet format before storing it in Amazon S3. For more information, see `Apache Parquet <https://parquet.apache.org/documentation/latest/>`__ .

                

                BlockSizeBytes -> (integer)

                  

                  The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) block size. This is useful if you intend to copy the data from Amazon S3 to HDFS before querying. The default is 256 MiB and the minimum is 64 MiB. Kinesis Data Firehose uses this value for padding calculations.

                  

                  

                PageSizeBytes -> (integer)

                  

                  The Parquet page size. Column chunks are divided into pages. A page is conceptually an indivisible unit (in terms of compression and encoding). The minimum value is 64 KiB and the default is 1 MiB.

                  

                  

                Compression -> (string)

                  

                  The compression code to use over data blocks. The possible values are ``UNCOMPRESSED`` , ``SNAPPY`` , and ``GZIP`` , with the default being ``SNAPPY`` . Use ``SNAPPY`` for higher decompression speed. Use ``GZIP`` if the compression ration is more important than speed.

                  

                  

                EnableDictionaryCompression -> (boolean)

                  

                  Indicates whether to enable dictionary compression.

                  

                  

                MaxPaddingBytes -> (integer)

                  

                  The maximum amount of padding to apply. This is useful if you intend to copy the data from Amazon S3 to HDFS before querying. The default is 0.

                  

                  

                WriterVersion -> (string)

                  

                  Indicates the version of row format to output. The possible values are ``V1`` and ``V2`` . The default is ``V1`` .

                  

                  

                

              OrcSerDe -> (structure)

                

                A serializer to use for converting data to the ORC format before storing it in Amazon S3. For more information, see `Apache ORC <https://orc.apache.org/docs/>`__ .

                

                StripeSizeBytes -> (integer)

                  

                  The number of bytes in each stripe. The default is 64 MiB and the minimum is 8 MiB.

                  

                  

                BlockSizeBytes -> (integer)

                  

                  The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) block size. This is useful if you intend to copy the data from Amazon S3 to HDFS before querying. The default is 256 MiB and the minimum is 64 MiB. Kinesis Data Firehose uses this value for padding calculations.

                  

                  

                RowIndexStride -> (integer)

                  

                  The number of rows between index entries. The default is 10,000 and the minimum is 1,000.

                  

                  

                EnablePadding -> (boolean)

                  

                  Set this to ``true`` to indicate that you want stripes to be padded to the HDFS block boundaries. This is useful if you intend to copy the data from Amazon S3 to HDFS before querying. The default is ``false`` .

                  

                  

                PaddingTolerance -> (double)

                  

                  A number between 0 and 1 that defines the tolerance for block padding as a decimal fraction of stripe size. The default value is 0.05, which means 5 percent of stripe size.

                   

                  For the default values of 64 MiB ORC stripes and 256 MiB HDFS blocks, the default block padding tolerance of 5 percent reserves a maximum of 3.2 MiB for padding within the 256 MiB block. In such a case, if the available size within the block is more than 3.2 MiB, a new, smaller stripe is inserted to fit within that space. This ensures that no stripe crosses block boundaries and causes remote reads within a node-local task.

                   

                  Kinesis Data Firehose ignores this parameter when  OrcSerDe$EnablePadding is ``false`` .

                  

                  

                Compression -> (string)

                  

                  The compression code to use over data blocks. The default is ``SNAPPY`` .

                  

                  

                BloomFilterColumns -> (list)

                  

                  The column names for which you want Kinesis Data Firehose to create bloom filters. The default is ``null`` .

                  

                  (string)

                    

                    

                  

                BloomFilterFalsePositiveProbability -> (double)

                  

                  The Bloom filter false positive probability (FPP). The lower the FPP, the bigger the Bloom filter. The default value is 0.05, the minimum is 0, and the maximum is 1.

                  

                  

                DictionaryKeyThreshold -> (double)

                  

                  Represents the fraction of the total number of non-null rows. To turn off dictionary encoding, set this fraction to a number that is less than the number of distinct keys in a dictionary. To always use dictionary encoding, set this threshold to 1.

                  

                  

                FormatVersion -> (string)

                  

                  The version of the file to write. The possible values are ``V0_11`` and ``V0_12`` . The default is ``V0_12`` .

                  

                  

                

              

            

          Enabled -> (boolean)

            

            Defaults to ``true`` . Set it to ``false`` if you want to disable format conversion while preserving the configuration details.
