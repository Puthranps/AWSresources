put-event-selectors
*******************



===========
Description
===========



Configures an event selector for your trail. Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event settings for your trail. By default, trails created without specific event selectors will be configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events. 

 

When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event. 

 

Example

 

 
* You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want write-only events. 
 
* The EC2 ``GetConsoleOutput`` and ``RunInstances`` API operations occur in your account. 
 
* CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors. 
 
* The ``RunInstances`` is a write-only event and it matches your event selector. The trail logs the event. 
 
* The ``GetConsoleOutput`` is a read-only event but it doesn't match your event selector. The trail doesn't log the event.  
 

 

The ``PutEventSelectors`` operation must be called from the region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an ``InvalidHomeRegionException`` is thrown.

 

You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail.

``--trail-name`` (string)


  Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If you specify a trail name, the string must meet the following requirements:

   

   
  * Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores (_), or dashes (-) 
   
  * Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number 
   
  * Be between 3 and 128 characters 
   
  * Have no adjacent periods, underscores or dashes. Names like ``my-_namespace`` and ``my--namespace`` are invalid. 
   
  * Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4) 
   

   

  If you specify a trail ARN, it must be in the format:

   

   ``arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail``  

  

``--event-selectors`` (list)


  Specifies the settings for your event selectors. You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.

  



JSON Syntax::

      ]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

**To configure event selectors for a trail**

To create an event selector, run the ''put-event-selectors'' command. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates 
the configuration for your trails. If the event matches any event selector for a trail, the trail processes and logs the event. 
You can configure up to 5 event selectors for a trail and up to 250 data resources for a trail.

The following example creates an event selector for a trail named ''TrailName'' to include read-only and write-only management events, 
data events for two Amazon S3 bucket/prefix combinations, and data events for a single AWS Lambda function named ''hello-world-python-function''::



  aws cloudtrail put-event-selectors --trail-name TrailName --event-selectors '[{"ReadWriteType": "All","IncludeManagementEvents": true,"DataResources": [{"Type":"AWS::S3::Object", "Values": ["arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/prefix","arn:aws:s3:::mybucket2/prefix2"]},{"Type": "AWS::Lambda::Function","Values": ["arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:999999999999:function:hello-world-python-function"]}]}]'

Output::

  {
    "EventSelectors": [
        {
            "IncludeManagementEvents": true,
            "DataResources": [
                {
                    "Values": [
                        "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/prefix",
                        "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket2/prefix2"
                    ],
                    "Type": "AWS::S3::Object"
                },
                {
                    "Values": [
                        "arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:hello-world-python-function"
                    ],
                    "Type": "AWS::Lambda::Function"
                },
            ],
            "ReadWriteType": "All"
        }
    ],
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/TrailName"
  }

The following example creates an event selector for a trail named ''TrailName2'' that includes all events, including read-only and write-only management events, and all data events for all Amazon S3 buckets and AWS Lambda functions in the AWS account::

  aws cloudtrail put-event-selectors --trail-name TrailName2 --event-selectors '[{"ReadWriteType": "All","IncludeManagementEvents": true,"DataResources": [{"Type":"AWS::S3::Object", "Values": ["arn:aws:s3:::"]},{"Type": "AWS::Lambda::Function","Values": ["arn:aws:lambda"]}]}]'

Output::

  {
    "EventSelectors": [
        {
            "IncludeManagementEvents": true,
            "DataResources": [
                {
                    "Values": [
                        "arn:aws:s3:::"
                    ],
                    "Type": "AWS::S3::Object"
                },
                {
                    "Values": [
                        "arn:aws:lambda"
                    ],
                    "Type": "AWS::Lambda::Function"
                },
            ],
            "ReadWriteType": "All"
        }
    ],
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/TrailName2"
  }

TrailARN -> (string)

  

  Specifies the ARN of the trail that was updated with event selectors. The format of a trail ARN is:

   

   ``arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail``  

  

  

EventSelectors -> (list)

  

  Specifies the event selectors configured for your trail.

  

  (structure)

    

    Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event settings for your trail. By default, trails created without specific event selectors will be configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selector for all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event.

     

    You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.

    

    ReadWriteType -> (string)

      

      Specify if you want your trail to log read-only events, write-only events, or all. For example, the EC2 ``GetConsoleOutput`` is a read-only API operation and ``RunInstances`` is a write-only API operation.

       

      By default, the value is ``All`` .

      

      

    IncludeManagementEvents -> (boolean)

      

      Specify if you want your event selector to include management events for your trail.

       

      For more information, see `Management Events <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#logging-management-events>`__ in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .

       

      By default, the value is ``true`` .

      

      

    DataResources -> (list)

      

      CloudTrail supports data event logging for Amazon S3 objects and AWS Lambda functions. You can specify up to 250 resources for an individual event selector, but the total number of data resources cannot exceed 250 across all event selectors in a trail. This limit does not apply if you configure resource logging for all data events. 

       

      For more information, see `Data Events <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#logging-data-events>`__ and `Limits in AWS CloudTrail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/WhatIsCloudTrail-Limits.html>`__ in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .

      

      (structure)

        

        The Amazon S3 buckets or AWS Lambda functions that you specify in your event selectors for your trail to log data events. Data events provide insight into the resource operations performed on or within a resource itself. These are also known as data plane operations. You can specify up to 250 data resources for a trail.

         

        .. note::

           

          The total number of allowed data resources is 250. This number can be distributed between 1 and 5 event selectors, but the total cannot exceed 250 across all selectors.

           

         

        The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket named ``bucket-1`` . In this example, the CloudTrail user spcified an empty prefix, and the option to log both ``Read`` and ``Write`` data events.

         

         
        * A user uploads an image file to ``bucket-1`` . 
         
        * The ``PutObject`` API operation is an Amazon S3 object-level API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3 bucket with an empty prefix, events that occur on any object in that bucket are logged. The trail processes and logs the event. 
         
        * A user uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named ``arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2`` . 
         
        * The ``PutObject`` API operation occurred for an object in an S3 bucket that the CloudTrail user didn't specify for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event. 
         

         

        The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of AWS Lambda data events for a Lambda function named *MyLambdaFunction* , but not for all AWS Lambda functions.

         

         
        * A user runs a script that includes a call to the *MyLambdaFunction* function and the *MyOtherLambdaFunction* function. 
         
        * The ``Invoke`` API operation on *MyLambdaFunction* is an AWS Lambda API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified logging data events for *MyLambdaFunction* , any invocations of that function are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.  
         
        * The ``Invoke`` API operation on *MyOtherLambdaFunction* is an AWS Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify logging data events for all Lambda functions, the ``Invoke`` operation for *MyOtherLambdaFunction* does not match the function specified for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.  
         

        

        Type -> (string)

          

          The resource type in which you want to log data events. You can specify ``AWS::S3::Object`` or ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` resources.

          

          

        Values -> (list)

          

          An array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or partial ARN strings for the specified objects.

           

           
          * To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets in your AWS account, specify the prefix as ``arn:aws:s3:::`` .  

          .. note::

             This will also enable logging of data event activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account, even if that activity is performed on a bucket that belongs to another AWS account.  

           
           
          * To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets that include *my-bucket* in their names, specify the prefix as ``aws:s3:::my-bucket`` . The trail logs data events for all objects in all buckets whose name contains a match for *my-bucket* .  
           
          * To log data events for all objects in an S3 bucket, specify the bucket and an empty object prefix such as ``arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/`` . The trail logs data events for all objects in this S3 bucket. 
           
          * To log data events for specific objects, specify the S3 bucket and object prefix such as ``arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/example-images`` . The trail logs data events for objects in this S3 bucket that match the prefix. 
           
          * To log data events for all functions in your AWS account, specify the prefix as ``arn:aws:lambda`` . 

          .. note::

             This will also enable logging of ``Invoke`` activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account, even if that activity is performed on a function that belongs to another AWS account.  

           
           
          * To log data eents for a specific Lambda function, specify the function ARN. 

          .. note::

             Lambda function ARNs are exact. Unlike S3, you cannot use matching. For example, if you specify a function ARN *arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld* , data events will only be logged for *arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld* . They will not be logged for *arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld2* .
