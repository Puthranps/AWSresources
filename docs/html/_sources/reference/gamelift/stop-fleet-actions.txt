stop-fleet-actions
******************



===========
Description
===========



Suspends activity on a fleet. Currently, this operation is used to stop a fleet's auto-scaling activity. It is used to temporarily stop scaling events triggered by the fleet's scaling policies. The policies can be retained and auto-scaling activity can be restarted using  StartFleetActions . You can view a fleet's stopped actions using  DescribeFleetAttributes .

 

To stop fleet actions, specify the fleet ID and the type of actions to suspend. When auto-scaling fleet actions are stopped, Amazon GameLift no longer initiates scaling events except to maintain the fleet's desired instances setting ( FleetCapacity . Changes to the fleet's capacity must be done manually using  UpdateFleetCapacity .

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
