===========
Description
===========



Removes a VPC peering connection. To delete the connection, you must have a valid authorization for the VPC peering connection that you want to delete. You can check for an authorization by calling  DescribeVpcPeeringAuthorizations or request a new one using  CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization . 

 

Once a valid authorization exists, call this operation from the AWS account that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets. Identify the connection to delete by the connection ID and fleet ID. If successful, the connection is removed. 

 

VPC peering connection operations include:

 

 
*  CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization   
 
*  DescribeVpcPeeringAuthorizations   
 
*  DeleteVpcPeeringAuthorization   
 
*  CreateVpcPeeringConnection   
 
*  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections   
 
*  DeleteVpcPeeringConnection

Options

``--fleet-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for a fleet. This value must match the fleet ID referenced in the VPC peering connection record.

  

``--vpc-peering-connection-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for a VPC peering connection. This value is included in the  VpcPeeringConnection object, which can be retrieved by calling  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
