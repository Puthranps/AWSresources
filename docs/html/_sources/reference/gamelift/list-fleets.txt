Synopsis

::

    list-fleets

  [--limit <value>]
  [--next-token <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--build-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for a build to return fleets for. Use this parameter to return only fleets using the specified build. To retrieve all fleets, leave this parameter empty.

  

``--limit`` (integer)


  Maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with ``NextToken`` to get results as a set of sequential pages.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this action. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

FleetIds -> (list)

  

  Set of fleet IDs matching the list request. You can retrieve additional information about all returned fleets by passing this result set to a call to  DescribeFleetAttributes ,  DescribeFleetCapacity , or  DescribeFleetUtilization .

  

  (string)

    

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  Token that indicates where to resume retrieving results on the next call to this action. If no token is returned, these results represent the end of the list.
