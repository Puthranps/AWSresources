``--game-lift-aws-account-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for the AWS account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleet. You can find your Account ID in the AWS Management Console under account settings.

  

``--peer-vpc-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your Amazon GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same region where your fleet is deployed. To get VPC information, including IDs, use the Virtual Private Cloud service tools, including the VPC Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
