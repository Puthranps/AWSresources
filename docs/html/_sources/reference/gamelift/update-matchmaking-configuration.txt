Options

``--name`` (string)


  Unique identifier for a matchmaking configuration to update.

  

``--description`` (string)


  Descriptive label that is associated with matchmaking configuration.

  

``--game-session-queue-arns`` (list)


  Amazon Resource Name (`ARN <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__ ) that is assigned to a game session queue and uniquely identifies it. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912`` . These queues are used when placing game sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configuration. Queues can be located in any region.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--request-timeout-seconds`` (integer)


  Maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain in process before timing out. Requests that time out can be resubmitted as needed.

  

``--acceptance-timeout-seconds`` (integer)


  Length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match. If any player rejects the match or fails to accept before the timeout, the ticket continues to look for an acceptable match.

  

``--acceptance-required`` | ``--no-acceptance-required`` (boolean)


  Flag that determines whether or not a match that was created with this configuration must be accepted by the matched players. To require acceptance, set to TRUE.

  

``--rule-set-name`` (string)


  Unique identifier for a matchmaking rule set to use with this configuration. A matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same region.

  

``--notification-target`` (string)


  SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking notifications. See `Setting up Notifications for Matchmaking <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-notification.html>`__ for more information.

  

``--additional-player-count`` (integer)


  Number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players. For example, if the configuration's rule set specifies a match for a single 12-person team, and the additional player count is set to 2, only 10 players are selected for the match.

  

``--custom-event-data`` (string)


  Information to attached to all events related to the matchmaking configuration. 

  

``--game-properties`` (list)


  Set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__ ). This information is added to the new  GameSession object that is created for a successful match. 

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Key=string,Value=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",
      "Value": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--game-session-data`` (string)


  Set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__ ). This information is added to the new  GameSession object that is created for a successful match. 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
