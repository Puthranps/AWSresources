===========
Description
===========



Updates game session properties. This includes the session name, maximum player count, protection policy, which controls whether or not an active game session can be terminated during a scale-down event, and the player session creation policy, which controls whether or not new players can join the session. To update a game session, specify the game session ID and the values you want to change. If successful, an updated  GameSession object is returned.

=======
Options
=======

``--game-session-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for the game session to update.

  

``--maximum-player-session-count`` (integer)


  Maximum number of players that can be connected simultaneously to the game session.

  

``--name`` (string)


  Descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Session names do not need to be unique.

  

``--player-session-creation-policy`` (string)


  Policy determining whether or not the game session accepts new players.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``ACCEPT_ALL``

  
  *   ``DENY_ALL``

  

  

``--protection-policy`` (string)


  Game session protection policy to apply to this game session only.

   

   
  * **NoProtection** -- The game session can be terminated during a scale-down event. 
   
  * **FullProtection** -- If the game session is in an ``ACTIVE`` status, it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event. 
   

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``NoProtection``

  
  *   ``FullProtection``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

GameSession -> (structure)

  

  Object that contains the updated game session metadata.

  

  GameSessionId -> (string)

    

    Unique identifier for the game session. A game session ARN has the following format: ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesession/<fleet ID>/<custom ID string or idempotency token>`` .

    

    

  Name -> (string)

    

    Descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Session names do not need to be unique.

    

    

  FleetId -> (string)

    

    Unique identifier for a fleet that the game session is running on.

    

    

  CreationTime -> (timestamp)

    

    Time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").

    

    

  TerminationTime -> (timestamp)

    

    Time stamp indicating when this data object was terminated. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").

    

    

  CurrentPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)

    

    Number of players currently in the game session.

    

    

  MaximumPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)

    

    Maximum number of players that can be connected simultaneously to the game session.

    

    

  Status -> (string)

    

    Current status of the game session. A game session must have an ``ACTIVE`` status to have player sessions.

    

    

  StatusReason -> (string)

    

    Provides additional information about game session status. ``INTERRUPTED`` indicates that the game session was hosted on a spot instance that was reclaimed, causing the active game session to be terminated.

    

    

  GameProperties -> (list)

    

    Set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__ ). You can search for active game sessions based on this custom data with  SearchGameSessions .

    

    (structure)

      

      Set of key-value pairs that contain information about a game session. When included in a game session request, these properties communicate details to be used when setting up the new game session, such as to specify a game mode, level, or map. Game properties are passed to the game server process when initiating a new game session; the server process uses the properties as appropriate. For more information, see the `Amazon GameLift Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#gamelift-sdk-client-api-create>`__ .

      

      Key -> (string)

        

        Game property identifier.

        

        

      Value -> (string)

        

        Game property value.

        

        

      

    

  IpAddress -> (string)

    

    IP address of the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

    

    

  Port -> (integer)

    

    Port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

    

    

  PlayerSessionCreationPolicy -> (string)

    

    Indicates whether or not the game session is accepting new players.

    

    

  CreatorId -> (string)

    

    Unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the number of game sessions a player can create.

    

    

  GameSessionData -> (string)

    

    Set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__ ).

    

    

  MatchmakerData -> (string)

    

    Information about the matchmaking process that was used to create the game session. It is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. In addition the matchmaking configuration used, it contains data on all players assigned to the match, including player attributes and team assignments. For more details on matchmaker data, see `Match Data <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-server.html#match-server-data>`__ . Matchmaker data is useful when requesting match backfills, and is updated whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see  StartMatchBackfill ).
