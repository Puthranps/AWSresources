===========
Description
===========



Establishes a VPC peering connection between a virtual private cloud (VPC) in an AWS account with the VPC for your Amazon GameLift fleet. VPC peering enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other AWS resources. You can peer with VPCs in any AWS account that you have access to, including the account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different regions. For more information, see `VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html>`__ .

 

Before calling this operation to establish the peering connection, you first need to call  CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization and identify the VPC you want to peer with. Once the authorization for the specified VPC is issued, you have 24 hours to establish the connection. These two operations handle all tasks necessary to peer the two VPCs, including acceptance, updating routing tables, etc. 

 

To establish the connection, call this operation from the AWS account that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the fleet you want to be enable a VPC peering connection for; (2) The AWS account with the VPC that you want to peer with; and (3) The ID of the VPC you want to peer with. This operation is asynchronous. If successful, a  VpcPeeringConnection request is created. You can use continuous polling to track the request's status using  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections , or by monitoring fleet events for success or failure using  DescribeFleetEvents . 

 

VPC peering connection operations include:

 

 
*  CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization   
 
*  DescribeVpcPeeringAuthorizations   
 
*  DeleteVpcPeeringAuthorization   
 
*  CreateVpcPeeringConnection   
 
*  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections   
 
*  DeleteVpcPeeringConnection

  [--cli-input-json <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--fleet-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for a fleet. This tells Amazon GameLift which GameLift VPC to peer with. 

  

``--peer-vpc-aws-account-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for the AWS account with the VPC that you want to peer your Amazon GameLift fleet with. You can find your Account ID in the AWS Management Console under account settings.

  

``--peer-vpc-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your Amazon GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same region where your fleet is deployed. To get VPC information, including IDs, use the Virtual Private Cloud service tools, including the VPC Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
