When specifying a list of names, only configurations that currently exist are returned.

Options

``--names`` (list)


  Unique identifier for a matchmaking configuration(s) to retrieve. To request all existing configurations, leave this parameter empty.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--rule-set-name`` (string)


  Unique identifier for a matchmaking rule set. Use this parameter to retrieve all matchmaking configurations that use this rule set.

  

``--limit`` (integer)


  Maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with ``NextToken`` to get results as a set of sequential pages. This parameter is limited to 10.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this action. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

    Guidelines for use with FlexMatch to match players into games. All matchmaking requests must specify a matchmaking configuration.

    

    Name -> (string)

      

      Unique identifier for a matchmaking configuration. This name is used to identify the configuration associated with a matchmaking request or ticket.

      

      

    Description -> (string)

      

      Descriptive label that is associated with matchmaking configuration.

      

      

    GameSessionQueueArns -> (list)

      

      Amazon Resource Name (`ARN <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__ ) that is assigned to a game session queue and uniquely identifies it. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912`` . These queues are used when placing game sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configuration. Queues can be located in any region.

    AcceptanceRequired -> (boolean)

    GameProperties -> (list)

        Set of key-value pairs that contain information about a game session. When included in a game session request, these properties communicate details to be used when setting up the new game session, such as to specify a game mode, level, or map. Game properties are passed to the game server process when initiating a new game session; the server process uses the properties as appropriate. For more information, see the `Amazon GameLift Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#gamelift-sdk-client-api-create>`__ .
