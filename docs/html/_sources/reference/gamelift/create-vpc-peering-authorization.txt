===========
Description
===========



Requests authorization to create or delete a peer connection between the VPC for your Amazon GameLift fleet and a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your AWS account. VPC peering enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other AWS resources. Once you've received authorization, call  CreateVpcPeeringConnection to establish the peering connection. For more information, see `VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html>`__ .

 

You can peer with VPCs that are owned by any AWS account you have access to, including the account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different regions.

 

To request authorization to create a connection, call this operation from the AWS account with the VPC that you want to peer to your Amazon GameLift fleet. For example, to enable your game servers to retrieve data from a DynamoDB table, use the account that manages that DynamoDB resource. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the VPC that you want to peer with, and (2) the ID of the AWS account that you use to manage Amazon GameLift. If successful, VPC peering is authorized for the specified VPC. 

 

To request authorization to delete a connection, call this operation from the AWS account with the VPC that is peered with your Amazon GameLift fleet. Identify the following values: (1) VPC ID that you want to delete the peering connection for, and (2) ID of the AWS account that you use to manage Amazon GameLift. 

 

The authorization remains valid for 24 hours unless it is canceled by a call to  DeleteVpcPeeringAuthorization . You must create or delete the peering connection while the authorization is valid.

=======
Options
=======

``--game-lift-aws-account-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for the AWS account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleet. You can find your Account ID in the AWS Management Console under account settings.

  

``--peer-vpc-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your Amazon GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same region where your fleet is deployed. To get VPC information, including IDs, use the Virtual Private Cloud service tools, including the VPC Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
