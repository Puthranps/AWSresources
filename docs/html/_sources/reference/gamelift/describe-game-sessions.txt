===========
Description
===========



Retrieves a set of one or more game sessions. Request a specific game session or request all game sessions on a fleet. Alternatively, use  SearchGameSessions to request a set of active game sessions that are filtered by certain criteria. To retrieve protection policy settings for game sessions, use  DescribeGameSessionDetails .

 

To get game sessions, specify one of the following: game session ID, fleet ID, or alias ID. You can filter this request by game session status. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a  GameSession object is returned for each game session matching the request.

=======
Options
=======

``--fleet-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for a fleet to retrieve all game sessions for.

  

``--game-session-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for the game session to retrieve. You can use either a ``GameSessionId`` or ``GameSessionArn`` value. 

  

``--alias-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for an alias associated with the fleet to retrieve all game sessions for. 

  

``--status-filter`` (string)


  Game session status to filter results on. Possible game session statuses include ``ACTIVE`` , ``TERMINATED`` , ``ACTIVATING`` , and ``TERMINATING`` (the last two are transitory). 

  

``--limit`` (integer)


  Maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with ``NextToken`` to get results as a set of sequential pages.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this action. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

GameSessions -> (list)

  

  Collection of objects containing game session properties for each session matching the request.

  

  (structure)

    

    Properties describing a game session.

     

    A game session in ACTIVE status can host players. When a game session ends, its status is set to ``TERMINATED`` . 

     

    Once the session ends, the game session object is retained for 30 days. This means you can reuse idempotency token values after this time. Game session logs are retained for 14 days.

    *  DescribeGameSessions   
     
    *  DescribeGameSessionDetails

    GameSessionId -> (string)

      

      Unique identifier for the game session. A game session ARN has the following format: ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesession/<fleet ID>/<custom ID string or idempotency token>`` .

      

      

    Name -> (string)

      

      Descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Session names do not need to be unique.

      

      

    FleetId -> (string)

      

      Unique identifier for a fleet that the game session is running on.

      

      

    CreationTime -> (timestamp)

      

      Time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").

      

      

    TerminationTime -> (timestamp)

      

      Time stamp indicating when this data object was terminated. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").

      

      

    CurrentPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)

      

      Number of players currently in the game session.

      

      

    MaximumPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)

      

      Maximum number of players that can be connected simultaneously to the game session.

      

      

    Status -> (string)

      

      Current status of the game session. A game session must have an ``ACTIVE`` status to have player sessions.

      

      

    StatusReason -> (string)

      

      Provides additional information about game session status. ``INTERRUPTED`` indicates that the game session was hosted on a spot instance that was reclaimed, causing the active game session to be terminated.

      

      

    GameProperties -> (list)

      

      Set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__ ). You can search for active game sessions based on this custom data with  SearchGameSessions .

      

      (structure)

        

        Set of key-value pairs that contain information about a game session. When included in a game session request, these properties communicate details to be used when setting up the new game session, such as to specify a game mode, level, or map. Game properties are passed to the game server process when initiating a new game session; the server process uses the properties as appropriate. For more information, see the `Amazon GameLift Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#gamelift-sdk-client-api-create>`__ .

        

        Key -> (string)

          

          Game property identifier.

          

          

        Value -> (string)

          

          Game property value.

          

          

        

      

    IpAddress -> (string)

      

      IP address of the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

      

      

    Port -> (integer)

      

      Port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

      

      

    PlayerSessionCreationPolicy -> (string)

      

      Indicates whether or not the game session is accepting new players.

      

      

    CreatorId -> (string)

      

      Unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the number of game sessions a player can create.

      

      

    GameSessionData -> (string)

      

      Set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__ ).

      

      

    MatchmakerData -> (string)

      

      Information about the matchmaking process that was used to create the game session. It is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. In addition the matchmaking configuration used, it contains data on all players assigned to the match, including player attributes and team assignments. For more details on matchmaker data, see `Match Data <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-server.html#match-server-data>`__ . Matchmaker data is useful when requesting match backfills, and is updated whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see  StartMatchBackfill ). 

      

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  Token that indicates where to resume retrieving results on the next call to this action. If no token is returned, these results represent the end of the list.
