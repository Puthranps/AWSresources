*******************
create-game-session
*******************



===========
Description
===========



Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This action creates a game session record and assigns an available server process in the specified fleet to host the game session. A fleet must have an ``ACTIVE`` status before a game session can be created in it.

 

To create a game session, specify either fleet ID or alias ID and indicate a maximum number of players to allow in the game session. You can also provide a name and game-specific properties for this game session. If successful, a  GameSession object is returned containing the game session properties and other settings you specified.

 

 **Idempotency tokens.** You can add a token that uniquely identifies game session requests. This is useful for ensuring that game session requests are idempotent. Multiple requests with the same idempotency token are processed only once; subsequent requests return the original result. All response values are the same with the exception of game session status, which may change.

 

 **Resource creation limits.** If you are creating a game session on a fleet with a resource creation limit policy in force, then you must specify a creator ID. Without this ID, Amazon GameLift has no way to evaluate the policy for this new game session request.

 

 **Player acceptance policy.** By default, newly created game sessions are open to new players. You can restrict new player access by using  UpdateGameSession to change the game session's player session creation policy.

 

 **Game session logs.** Logs are retained for all active game sessions for 14 days. To access the logs, call  GetGameSessionLogUrl to download the log files.

=======
Options
=======

``--fleet-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for a fleet to create a game session in. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

  

``--alias-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for an alias associated with the fleet to create a game session in. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

  

``--maximum-player-session-count`` (integer)


  Maximum number of players that can be connected simultaneously to the game session.

  

``--name`` (string)


  Descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Session names do not need to be unique.

  

``--game-properties`` (list)


  Set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__ ).

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",
      "Value": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--creator-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for a player or entity creating the game session. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection policy (if one exists) that limits the number of concurrent active game sessions one player can have.

  

``--game-session-id`` (string)


   *This parameter is no longer preferred. Please use ``IdempotencyToken`` instead.* Custom string that uniquely identifies a request for a new game session. Maximum token length is 48 characters. If provided, this string is included in the new game session's ID. (A game session ARN has the following format: ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesession/<fleet ID>/<custom ID string or idempotency token>`` .) 

  

``--idempotency-token`` (string)


  Custom string that uniquely identifies a request for a new game session. Maximum token length is 48 characters. If provided, this string is included in the new game session's ID. (A game session ARN has the following format: ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesession/<fleet ID>/<custom ID string or idempotency token>`` .) Idempotency tokens remain in use for 30 days after a game session has ended; game session objects are retained for this time period and then deleted.

  

``--game-session-data`` (string)


  Set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__ ).

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

    Maximum number of players that can be connected simultaneously to the game session.

    

    

  Status -> (string)

    

    Current status of the game session. A game session must have an ``ACTIVE`` status to have player sessions.

    

    

  StatusReason -> (string)

    

    Provides additional information about game session status. ``INTERRUPTED`` indicates that the game session was hosted on a spot instance that was reclaimed, causing the active game session to be terminated.

    

    

  GameProperties -> (list)

    

    Set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__ ). You can search for active game sessions based on this custom data with  SearchGameSessions .

    

    (structure)

      

      Set of key-value pairs that contain information about a game session. When included in a game session request, these properties communicate details to be used when setting up the new game session, such as to specify a game mode, level, or map. Game properties are passed to the game server process when initiating a new game session; the server process uses the properties as appropriate. For more information, see the `Amazon GameLift Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#gamelift-sdk-client-api-create>`__ .

    Indicates whether or not the game session is accepting new players.

    

    

  CreatorId -> (string)

  GameSessionData -> (string)

    

    Set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__ ).

    

    

  MatchmakerData -> (string)

    

    Information about the matchmaking process that was used to create the game session. It is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. In addition the matchmaking configuration used, it contains data on all players assigned to the match, including player attributes and team assignments.
