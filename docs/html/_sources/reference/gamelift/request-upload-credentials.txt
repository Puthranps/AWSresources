Description

Retrieves a fresh set of credentials for use when uploading a new set of game build files to Amazon GameLift's Amazon S3. This is done as part of the build creation process; see  CreateBuild .

 

To request new credentials, specify the build ID as returned with an initial ``CreateBuild`` request. If successful, a new set of credentials are returned, along with the S3 storage location associated with the build ID.

``--build-id`` (string)


  Unique identifier for a build to get credentials for.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
