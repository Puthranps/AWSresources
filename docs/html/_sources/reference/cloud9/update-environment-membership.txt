Options
=======

``--environment-id`` (string)


  The ID of the environment for the environment member whose settings you want to change.

  

``--user-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the environment member whose settings you want to change.

  The replacement type of environment member permissions you want to associate with this environment member. Available values include:

   

   
  * ``read-only`` : Has read-only access to the environment. 
   
  * ``read-write`` : Has read-write access to the environment. 
   

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``read-write``

  
  *   ``read-only``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
