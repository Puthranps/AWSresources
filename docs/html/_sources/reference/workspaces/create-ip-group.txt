===========
Description
===========



Creates an IP access control group.

 

An IP access control group provides you with the ability to control the IP addresses from which users are allowed to access their WorkSpaces. To specify the CIDR address ranges, add rules to your IP access control group and then associate the group with your directory. You can add rules when you create the group or at any time using  AuthorizeIpRules .

 

There is a default IP access control group associated with your directory. If you don't associate an IP access control group with your directory, the default group is used. The default group includes a default rule that allows users to access their WorkSpaces from anywhere. You cannot modify the default IP access control group for your directory.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
