===========
Description
===========



Rebuilds the specified WorkSpace.

 

You cannot rebuild a WorkSpace unless its state is ``AVAILABLE`` , ``ERROR`` , or ``UNHEALTHY`` .

 

Rebuilding a WorkSpace is a potentially destructive action that can result in the loss of data. For more information, see `Rebuild a WorkSpace <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/reset-workspace.html>`__ .

 

This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpaces have been completely rebuilt.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Options

``--rebuild-workspace-requests`` (list)


  The WorkSpace to rebuild. You can specify a single WorkSpace.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    --rebuild-workspace-requests WorkspaceId1 WorkspaceId2 WorkspaceId3




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "WorkspaceId": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
