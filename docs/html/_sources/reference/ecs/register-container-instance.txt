=======
Options
=======

``--cluster`` (string)


  The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster with which to register your container instance. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

  

``--instance-identity-document`` (string)


  The instance identity document for the EC2 instance to register. This document can be found by running the following command from the instance: ``curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document/``  

  

``--instance-identity-document-signature`` (string)


  The instance identity document signature for the EC2 instance to register. This signature can be found by running the following command from the instance: ``curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/signature/``  

  

``--total-resources`` (list)


  The resources available on the instance.

    ...
  ]



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

containerInstance -> (structure)

  

  The container instance that was registered.

  

  containerInstanceArn -> (string)

    

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container instance. The ARN contains the ``arn:aws:ecs`` namespace, followed by the Region of the container instance, the AWS account ID of the container instance owner, the ``container-instance`` namespace, and then the container instance ID. For example, ``arn:aws:ecs:*region* :*aws_account_id* :container-instance/*container_instance_ID* `` .

    

    

  ec2InstanceId -> (string)

    

    The EC2 instance ID of the container instance.

    

    

  version -> (long)

    

    The version counter for the container instance. Every time a container instance experiences a change that triggers a CloudWatch event, the version counter is incremented. If you are replicating your Amazon ECS container instance state with CloudWatch Events, you can compare the version of a container instance reported by the Amazon ECS APIs with the version reported in CloudWatch Events for the container instance (inside the ``detail`` object) to verify that the version in your event stream is current.

    

    

  versionInfo -> (structure)

    

    The version information for the Amazon ECS container agent and Docker daemon running on the container instance.

    

    agentVersion -> (string)

      

      The version number of the Amazon ECS container agent.

      

      

    agentHash -> (string)

      integerValue -> (integer)

        

        When the ``integerValue`` type is set, the value of the resource must be an integer.

        

        

      stringSetValue -> (list)

        

        When the ``stringSetValue`` type is set, the value of the resource must be a string type.

        

        (string)
