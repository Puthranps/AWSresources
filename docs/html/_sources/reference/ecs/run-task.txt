===========
Description
===========



Starts a new task using the specified task definition.

 

You can allow Amazon ECS to place tasks for you, or you can customize how Amazon ECS places tasks using placement constraints and placement strategies. For more information, see `Scheduling Tasks <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

 

Alternatively, you can use  StartTask to use your own scheduler or place tasks manually on specific container instances.

 

The Amazon ECS API follows an eventual consistency model, due to the distributed nature of the system supporting the API. This means that the result of an API command you run that affects your Amazon ECS resources might not be immediately visible to all subsequent commands you run. You should keep this in mind when you carry out an API command that immediately follows a previous API command.

 

To manage eventual consistency, you can do the following:

 

 
* Confirm the state of the resource before you run a command to modify it. Run the DescribeTasks command using an exponential backoff algorithm to ensure that you allow enough time for the previous command to propagate through the system. To do this, run the DescribeTasks command repeatedly, starting with a couple of seconds of wait time and increasing gradually up to five minutes of wait time. 
 
* Add wait time between subsequent commands, even if the DescribeTasks command returns an accurate response. Apply an exponential backoff algorithm starting with a couple of seconds of wait time, and increase gradually up to about five minutes of wait time.

=======
Options
=======

``--cluster`` (string)


  The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster on which to run your task. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

  

``--task-definition`` (string)


  The ``family`` and ``revision`` (``family:revision`` ) or full ARN of the task definition to run. If a ``revision`` is not specified, the latest ``ACTIVE`` revision is used.

  

``--overrides`` (structure)


  A list of container overrides in JSON format that specify the name of a container in the specified task definition and the overrides it should receive. You can override the default command for a container (that is specified in the task definition or Docker image) with a ``command`` override. You can also override existing environment variables (that are specified in the task definition or Docker image) on a container or add new environment variables to it with an ``environment`` override.

   

  .. note::

     

    A total of 8192 characters are allowed for overrides. This limit includes the JSON formatting characters of the override structure.

     

  



JSON Syntax::

  {
    "containerOverrides": [
      {
        "name": "string",
        "command": ["string", ...],
        "environment": [
          {
            "name": "string",
            "value": "string"
          }
          ...
        ],
        "cpu": integer,
        "memory": integer,
        "memoryReservation": integer
      }
      ...
    ],
    "taskRoleArn": "string",
    "executionRoleArn": "string"
  }



``--count`` (integer)


  The number of instantiations of the specified task to place on your cluster. You can specify up to 10 tasks per call.

  

``--started-by`` (string)


  An optional tag specified when a task is started. For example if you automatically trigger a task to run a batch process job, you could apply a unique identifier for that job to your task with the ``startedBy`` parameter. You can then identify which tasks belong to that job by filtering the results of a  ListTasks call with the ``startedBy`` value. Up to 36 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.

   

  If a task is started by an Amazon ECS service, then the ``startedBy`` parameter contains the deployment ID of the service that starts it.

  

``--group`` (string)


  The name of the task group to associate with the task. The default value is the family name of the task definition (for example, family:my-family-name).

  

``--placement-constraints`` (list)


  An array of placement constraint objects to use for the task. You can specify up to 10 constraints per task (including constraints in the task definition and those specified at run time).

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    type=string,expression=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "type": "distinctInstance"|"memberOf",
      "expression": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--placement-strategy`` (list)


  The placement strategy objects to use for the task. You can specify a maximum of five strategy rules per task.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    type=string,field=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "type": "random"|"spread"|"binpack",
      "field": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--launch-type`` (string)


  The launch type on which to run your task.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``EC2``

  
  *   ``FARGATE``

  

  

``--platform-version`` (string)


  The platform version on which to run your task. If one is not specified, the latest version is used by default.

  

``--network-configuration`` (structure)


  The network configuration for the task. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the ``awsvpc`` network mode to receive their own Elastic Network Interface, and it is not supported for other network modes. For more information, see `Task Networking <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[string,string],securityGroups=[string,string],assignPublicIp=string}




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "awsvpcConfiguration": {
      "subnets": ["string", ...],
      "securityGroups": ["string", ...],
      "assignPublicIp": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
    }
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

      .. note::

         

        The Amazon ECS container agent does not monitor or report on Docker health checks that are embedded in a container image (such as those specified in a parent image or from the image's Dockerfile) and not specified in the container definition. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks that exist in the container image.
