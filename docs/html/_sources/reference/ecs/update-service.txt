Description
===========



Modifies the desired count, deployment configuration, network configuration, or task definition used in a service.

 

You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new ``desiredCount`` parameter.

 

If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to determine the deployment strategy.

 

.. note::

   

  If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task definition for your service (for example, ``my_image:latest`` ), you do not need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service using the ``forceNewDeployment`` option. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they start.

   

 

You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, ``minimumHealthyPercent`` and ``maximumPercent`` , to determine the deployment strategy.

 

 
* If ``minimumHealthyPercent`` is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore ``desiredCount`` temporarily during a deployment. For example, if ``desiredCount`` is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the ``RUNNING`` state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the ``RUNNING`` state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. 
 
* The ``maximumPercent`` parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if ``desiredCount`` is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). 
 

 

When  UpdateService stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of ``docker stop`` is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a ``SIGTERM`` and a 30-second timeout, after which ``SIGKILL`` is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the ``SIGTERM`` gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no ``SIGKILL`` is sent.

 

When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following logic:

 

 
* Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes). 
 
* By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy): 

   
  * Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement. 
   
  * Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service. 
   

 
 

 

When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic: 

 

 
* Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for termination. 
 
* Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the largest number of running tasks for this service.

=======
Options
=======

``--cluster`` (string)


  The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that your service is running on. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

  

``--service`` (string)


  The name of the service to update.

  

``--desired-count`` (integer)


  The number of instantiations of the task to place and keep running in your service.

  

``--task-definition`` (string)


  The ``family`` and ``revision`` (``family:revision`` ) or full ARN of the task definition to run in your service. If a ``revision`` is not specified, the latest ``ACTIVE`` revision is used. If you modify the task definition with ``UpdateService`` , Amazon ECS spawns a task with the new version of the task definition and then stops an old task after the new version is running.

  

``--deployment-configuration`` (structure)


  Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    maximumPercent=integer,minimumHealthyPercent=integer




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "maximumPercent": integer,
    "minimumHealthyPercent": integer
  }



``--network-configuration`` (structure)


  The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the ``awsvpc`` network mode to receive their own elastic network interface, and it is not supported for other network modes. For more information, see `Task Networking <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

   

  .. note::

     

    Updating a service to add a subnet to a list of existing subnets does not trigger a service deployment. For example, if your network configuration change is to keep the existing subnets and simply add another subnet to the network configuration, this does not trigger a new service deployment.

     

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[string,string],securityGroups=[string,string],assignPublicIp=string}




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "awsvpcConfiguration": {
      "subnets": ["string", ...],
      "securityGroups": ["string", ...],
      "assignPublicIp": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
    }
  }



``--platform-version`` (string)


  The platform version that your service should run.

  

``--force-new-deployment`` | ``--no-force-new-deployment`` (boolean)


  Whether to force a new deployment of the service. Deployments are not forced by default. You can use this option to trigger a new deployment with no service definition changes. For example, you can update a service's tasks to use a newer Docker image with the same image/tag combination (``my_image:latest`` ) or to roll Fargate tasks onto a newer platform version.

  

``--health-check-grace-period-seconds`` (integer)


  The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after a task has first started. This is only valid if your service is configured to use a load balancer. If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to 1,800 seconds during which the ECS service scheduler ignores the Elastic Load Balancing health check status. This grace period can prevent the ECS service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

        The type of placement strategy. The ``random`` placement strategy randomly places tasks on available candidates. The ``spread`` placement strategy spreads placement across available candidates evenly based on the ``field`` parameter. The ``binpack`` strategy places tasks on available candidates that have the least available amount of the resource that is specified with the ``field`` parameter. For example, if you binpack on memory, a task is placed on the instance with the least amount of remaining memory (but still enough to run the task).

    The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after a task has first started.

    

    

  schedulingStrategy -> (string)

    

    The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more information, see `Services <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguideecs_services.html>`__ .

     

    There are two service scheduler strategies available:

     

     
    * ``REPLICA`` -The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. 
     
    * ``DAEMON`` -The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each container instance in your cluster. When using this strategy, do not specify a desired number of tasks or any task placement strategies. 

    .. note::

       Fargate tasks do not support the ``DAEMON`` scheduling strategy.
