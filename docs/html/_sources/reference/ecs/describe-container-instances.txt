Synopsis
========

::

    describe-container-instances
  [--cluster <value>]
  --container-instances <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--cluster`` (string)


  The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that hosts the container instances to describe. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

  

``--container-instances`` (list)


  A list of up to 100 container instance IDs or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) entries.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

**To describe container instance**

This example command provides a description of the specified container instance in the ``update`` cluster, using the container instance UUID as an identifier.

Command::

  aws ecs describe-container-instances --cluster update --container-instances 53ac7152-dcd1-4102-81f5-208962864132

containerInstances -> (list)

  

  The list of container instances.

  

  (structure)

    

    An EC2 instance that is running the Amazon ECS agent and has been registered with a cluster.

    

    containerInstanceArn -> (string)

      

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container instance. The ARN contains the ``arn:aws:ecs`` namespace, followed by the Region of the container instance, the AWS account ID of the container instance owner, the ``container-instance`` namespace, and then the container instance ID. For example, ``arn:aws:ecs:*region* :*aws_account_id* :container-instance/*container_instance_ID* `` .

      

      

    ec2InstanceId -> (string)

      

      The EC2 instance ID of the container instance.

      

      

    version -> (long)

      

      The version counter for the container instance. Every time a container instance experiences a change that triggers a CloudWatch event, the version counter is incremented. If you are replicating your Amazon ECS container instance state with CloudWatch Events, you can compare the version of a container instance reported by the Amazon ECS APIs with the version reported in CloudWatch Events for the container instance (inside the ``detail`` object) to verify that the version in your event stream is current.

      

      

    versionInfo -> (structure)

      

      The version information for the Amazon ECS container agent and Docker daemon running on the container instance.

      

      agentVersion -> (string)

        

        The version number of the Amazon ECS container agent.

        

        

      agentHash -> (string)

        

        The Git commit hash for the Amazon ECS container agent build on the `amazon-ecs-agent <https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/commits/master>`__ GitHub repository.

        

        

      dockerVersion -> (string)

        

        The Docker version running on the container instance.

        

        

      

    remainingResources -> (list)

      

      For CPU and memory resource types, this parameter describes the remaining CPU and memory that has not already been allocated to tasks and is therefore available for new tasks. For port resource types, this parameter describes the ports that were reserved by the Amazon ECS container agent (at instance registration time) and any task containers that have reserved port mappings on the host (with the ``host`` or ``bridge`` network mode). Any port that is not specified here is available for new tasks.

      

      (structure)

        

        Describes the resources available for a container instance.

        

        name -> (string)

          

          The name of the resource, such as ``CPU`` , ``MEMORY`` , ``PORTS`` , ``PORTS_UDP`` , or a user-defined resource.

          

          

        type -> (string)

          

          The type of the resource, such as ``INTEGER`` , ``DOUBLE`` , ``LONG`` , or ``STRINGSET`` .

          

          

        doubleValue -> (double)

          

          When the ``doubleValue`` type is set, the value of the resource must be a double precision floating-point type.

          

          

        longValue -> (long)

          

          When the ``longValue`` type is set, the value of the resource must be an extended precision floating-point type.

          

          

        integerValue -> (integer)

          

          When the ``integerValue`` type is set, the value of the resource must be an integer.

          

          

        stringSetValue -> (list)

          

          When the ``stringSetValue`` type is set, the value of the resource must be a string type.

          

          (string)

            

            

          

        

      

    registeredResources -> (list)

      

      For CPU and memory resource types, this parameter describes the amount of each resource that was available on the container instance when the container agent registered it with Amazon ECS; this value represents the total amount of CPU and memory that can be allocated on this container instance to tasks. For port resource types, this parameter describes the ports that were reserved by the Amazon ECS container agent when it registered the container instance with Amazon ECS.

    status -> (string)

      

      The status of the container instance. The valid values are ``ACTIVE`` , ``INACTIVE`` , or ``DRAINING`` . ``ACTIVE`` indicates that the container instance can accept tasks. ``DRAINING`` indicates that new tasks are not placed on the container instance and any service tasks running on the container instance are removed if possible.

      The elastic network interfaces associated with the container instance.

      

      (structure)

        

        An object representing a container instance or task attachment.

        

        id -> (string)
