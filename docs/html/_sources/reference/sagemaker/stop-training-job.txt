===========
Description
===========



Stops a training job. To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the ``SIGTERM`` signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms might use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of the training is not lost. 

 

Training algorithms provided by Amazon SageMaker save the intermediate results of a model training job. This intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use the model artifacts that are saved when Amazon SageMaker stops a training job to create a model. 

 

When it receives a ``StopTrainingJob`` request, Amazon SageMaker changes the status of the job to ``Stopping`` . After Amazon SageMaker stops the job, it sets the status to ``Stopped`` .

``--training-job-name`` (string)


  The name of the training job to stop.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
