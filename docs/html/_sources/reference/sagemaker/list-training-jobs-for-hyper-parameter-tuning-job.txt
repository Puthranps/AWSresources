=======
Options

``--hyper-parameter-tuning-job-name`` (string)


  The name of the tuning job whose training jobs you want to list.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  If the result of the previous ``ListTrainingJobsForHyperParameterTuningJob`` request was truncated, the response includes a ``NextToken`` . To retrieve the next set of training jobs, use the token in the next request.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of training jobs to return. The default value is 10.

  

``--status-equals`` (string)


  A filter that returns only training jobs with the specified status.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``InProgress``

  
  *   ``Completed``

  
  *   ``Failed``

  
  *   ``Stopping``

  
  *   ``Stopped``

  

  

``--sort-by`` (string)


  The field to sort results by. The default is ``Name`` .

   

  If the value of this field is ``FinalObjectiveMetricValue`` , any training jobs that did not return an objective metric are not listed.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``Name``

  
  *   ``CreationTime``

  
  *   ``Status``

  
  *   ``FinalObjectiveMetricValue``

  

  

``--sort-order`` (string)


  The sort order for results. The default is ``Ascending`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``Ascending``

  
  *   ``Descending``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

TrainingJobSummaries -> (list)

  

  A list of  TrainingJobSummary objects that describe the training jobs that the ``ListTrainingJobsForHyperParameterTuningJob`` request returned.

  

  (structure)

    

    Specifies summary information about a training job.

    

    TrainingJobName -> (string)

      

      The name of the training job.

      

      

    TrainingJobArn -> (string)

      

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the training job.

      

      

    CreationTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time that the training job was created.

      

      

    TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time that the training job started.

      

      

    TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time that the training job ended.

      

      

    TrainingJobStatus -> (string)

      

      The status of the training job.

      

      

    TunedHyperParameters -> (map)

      

      A list of the hyperparameters for which you specified ranges to search.

      

      key -> (string)

        

        

      value -> (string)

        

        

      

    FailureReason -> (string)

      

      The reason that the training job failed. 

      

      

    FinalHyperParameterTuningJobObjectiveMetric -> (structure)

      

      The  FinalHyperParameterTuningJobObjectiveMetric object that specifies the value of the objective metric of the tuning job that launched this training job.

      

      Type -> (string)

        

        Whether to minimize or maximize the objective metric. Valid values are Minimize and Maximize.

        

        

      MetricName -> (string)

        

        The name of the objective metric.

        

        

      Value -> (float)

        

        The value of the objective metric.

        

        

      

    ObjectiveStatus -> (string)

      

      The status of the objective metric for the training job:

       

       
      * Succeeded: The final objective metric for the training job was evaluated by the hyperparameter tuning job and used in the hyperparameter tuning process. 
       

       

       
      * Pending: The training job is in progress and evaluation of its final objective metric is pending. 
       

       

       
      * Failed: The final objective metric for the training job was not evaluated, and was not used in the hyperparameter tuning process. This typically occurs when the training job failed or did not emit an objective metric. 
       

      

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  If the result of this ``ListTrainingJobsForHyperParameterTuningJob`` request was truncated, the response includes a ``NextToken`` . To retrieve the next set of training jobs, use the token in the next request.
