=======
Options
=======

``--next-token`` (string)


  If the result of a ``ListNotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigs`` request was truncated, the response includes a ``NextToken`` . To get the next set of lifecycle configurations, use the token in the next request.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of lifecycle configurations to return in the response.

  

``--sort-by`` (string)


  Sorts the list of results. The default is ``CreationTime`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``Name``

  
  *   ``CreationTime``

  
  *   ``LastModifiedTime``

  

  

``--sort-order`` (string)


  The sort order for results.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``Ascending``

  
  *   ``Descending``

  

  

``--name-contains`` (string)


  A string in the lifecycle configuration name. This filter returns only lifecycle configurations whose name contains the specified string.

  

``--creation-time-before`` (timestamp)


  A filter that returns only lifecycle configurations that were created before the specified time (timestamp).

  

``--creation-time-after`` (timestamp)


  A filter that returns only lifecycle configurations that were created after the specified time (timestamp).

  

``--last-modified-time-before`` (timestamp)


  A filter that returns only lifecycle configurations that were modified before the specified time (timestamp).

  

``--last-modified-time-after`` (timestamp)


  A filter that returns only lifecycle configurations that were modified after the specified time (timestamp).

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
