************
create-model

===========
Description
===========



Creates a model in Amazon SageMaker. In the request, you name the model and describe a primary container. For the primary container, you specify the docker image containing inference code, artifacts (from prior training), and custom environment map that the inference code uses when you deploy the model for predictions.

 

Use this API to create a model if you want to use Amazon SageMaker hosting services or run a batch transform job.

 

To host your model, you create an endpoint configuration with the ``CreateEndpointConfig`` API, and then create an endpoint with the ``CreateEndpoint`` API. Amazon SageMaker then deploys all of the containers that you defined for the model in the hosting environment. 

 

To run a batch transform using your model, you start a job with the ``CreateTransformJob`` API. Amazon SageMaker uses your model and your dataset to get inferences which are then saved to a specified S3 location.

 

In the ``CreateModel`` request, you must define a container with the ``PrimaryContainer`` parameter.

 

In the request, you also provide an IAM role that Amazon SageMaker can assume to access model artifacts and docker image for deployment on ML compute hosting instances or for batch transform jobs. In addition, you also use the IAM role to manage permissions the inference code needs. For example, if the inference code access any other AWS resources, you grant necessary permissions via this role.

=======
Options
=======

``--model-name`` (string)


  The name of the new model.

  

``--primary-container`` (structure)


  The location of the primary docker image containing inference code, associated artifacts, and custom environment map that the inference code uses when the model is deployed for predictions. 

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    ContainerHostname=string,Image=string,ModelDataUrl=string,Environment={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "ContainerHostname": "string",
    "Image": "string",
    "ModelDataUrl": "string",
    "Environment": {"string": "string"
      ...}
  }



``--execution-role-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Amazon SageMaker can assume to access model artifacts and docker image for deployment on ML compute instances or for batch transform jobs. Deploying on ML compute instances is part of model hosting. For more information, see `Amazon SageMaker Roles <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html>`__ . 

   

  .. note::

     

    To be able to pass this role to Amazon SageMaker, the caller of this API must have the ``iam:PassRole`` permission.

     

  

``--tags`` (list)


  An array of key-value pairs. For more information, see `Using Cost Allocation Tags <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html#allocation-what>`__ in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide* . 

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Key=string,Value=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",
      "Value": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--vpc-config`` (structure)


  A  VpcConfig object that specifies the VPC that you want your model to connect to. Control access to and from your model container by configuring the VPC. ``VpcConfig`` is currently used in hosting services but not in batch transform. For more information, see  host-vpc .

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    SecurityGroupIds=string,string,Subnets=string,string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...],
    "Subnets": ["string", ...]
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
