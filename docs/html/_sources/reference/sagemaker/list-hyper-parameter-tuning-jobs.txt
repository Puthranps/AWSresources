=======
Options
=======

``--next-token`` (string)


  If the result of the previous ``ListHyperParameterTuningJobs`` request was truncated, the response includes a ``NextToken`` . To retrieve the next set of tuning jobs, use the token in the next request.

  

``--max-results`` (integer)


  The maximum number of tuning jobs to return. The default value is 10.

  

``--sort-by`` (string)


  The field to sort results by. The default is ``Name`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``Name``

  
  *   ``Status``

  
  *   ``CreationTime``

  

  

``--sort-order`` (string)


  The sort order for results. The default is ``Ascending`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``Ascending``

  
  *   ``Descending``

  

  

``--name-contains`` (string)


  A string in the tuning job name. This filter returns only tuning jobs whose name contains the specified string.

  

``--creation-time-after`` (timestamp)


  A filter that returns only tuning jobs that were created after the specified time.

  

``--creation-time-before`` (timestamp)


  A filter that returns only tuning jobs that were created before the specified time.

  

``--last-modified-time-after`` (timestamp)


  A filter that returns only tuning jobs that were modified after the specified time.

  

``--last-modified-time-before`` (timestamp)


  A filter that returns only tuning jobs that were modified before the specified time.

  

``--status-equals`` (string)


  A filter that returns only tuning jobs with the specified status.

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``Completed``

  
  *   ``InProgress``

  
  *   ``Failed``

  
  *   ``Stopped``

  
  *   ``Stopping``

  

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output
======

HyperParameterTuningJobSummaries -> (list)

  

  A list of  HyperParameterTuningJobSummary objects that describe the tuning jobs that the ``ListHyperParameterTuningJobs`` request returned.

  

  (structure)

    

    Provides summary information about a hyperparameter tuning job.

    

    HyperParameterTuningJobName -> (string)

      

      The name of the tuning job.

      

      

    HyperParameterTuningJobArn -> (string)

      

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the tuning job.

      

      

    HyperParameterTuningJobStatus -> (string)

      

      The status of the tuning job.

      

      

    Strategy -> (string)

      

      Specifies the search strategy hyperparameter tuning uses to choose which hyperparameters to use for each iteration. Currently, the only valid value is Bayesian.

      

      

    CreationTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time that the tuning job was created.

      

      

    HyperParameterTuningEndTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time that the tuning job ended.

      

      

    LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time that the tuning job was modified.

      

      

    TrainingJobStatusCounters -> (structure)

      

      The  TrainingJobStatusCounters object that specifies the numbers of training jobs, categorized by status, that this tuning job launched.

      

      Completed -> (integer)

        

        The number of completed training jobs launched by a hyperparameter tuning job.

        

        

      InProgress -> (integer)

        

        The number of in-progress training jobs launched by a hyperparameter tuning job.

        

        

      RetryableError -> (integer)

        

        The number of training jobs that failed, but can be retried. A failed training job can be retried only if it failed because an internal service error occurred.

        

        

      NonRetryableError -> (integer)

        

        The number of training jobs that failed and can't be retried. A failed training job can't be retried if it failed because a client error occurred.

        

        

      Stopped -> (integer)

        

        The number of training jobs launched by a hyperparameter tuning job that were manually stopped.

        

        

      

    ObjectiveStatusCounters -> (structure)

      

      The  ObjectiveStatusCounters object that specifies the numbers of training jobs, categorized by objective metric status, that this tuning job launched.

      

      Succeeded -> (integer)

        

        The number of training jobs whose final objective metric was evaluated by the hyperparameter tuning job and used in the hyperparameter tuning process.

        

        

      Pending -> (integer)

        

        The number of training jobs that are in progress and pending evaluation of their final objective metric.

        

        

      Failed -> (integer)

        

        The number of training jobs whose final objective metric was not evaluated and used in the hyperparameter tuning process. This typically occurs when the training job failed or did not emit an objective metric.

        

        

      

    ResourceLimits -> (structure)

      

      The  ResourceLimits object that specifies the maximum number of training jobs and parallel training jobs allowed for this tuning job.

      

      MaxNumberOfTrainingJobs -> (integer)

        

        The maximum number of training jobs that a hyperparameter tuning job can launch.

        

        

      MaxParallelTrainingJobs -> (integer)

        

        The maximum number of concurrent training jobs that a hyperparameter tuning job can launch.

        

        

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  If the result of this ``ListHyperParameterTuningJobs`` request was truncated, the response includes a ``NextToken`` . To retrieve the next set of tuning jobs, use the token in the next request.
