Options

``--endpoint-name`` (string)


  The name of the endpoint.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

EndpointName -> (string)

  

  Name of the endpoint.

  

  

EndpointArn -> (string)

  

  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint.

  

  

EndpointConfigName -> (string)

  

  The name of the endpoint configuration associated with this endpoint.

  

  

ProductionVariants -> (list)

  

  An array of  ProductionVariantSummary objects, one for each model hosted behind this endpoint. 

  

  (structure)

    

    Describes weight and capacities for a production variant associated with an endpoint. If you sent a request to the ``UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities`` API and the endpoint status is ``Updating`` , you get different desired and current values. 

    

    VariantName -> (string)

      

      The name of the variant.

      

      

    DeployedImages -> (list)

      

      An array of ``DeployedImage`` objects that specify the Amazon EC2 Container Registry paths of the inference images deployed on instances of this ``ProductionVariant`` .

      

      (structure)

        

        Gets the Amazon EC2 Container Registry path of the docker image of the model that is hosted in this  ProductionVariant .

         

        If you used the ``registry/repository[:tag]`` form to to specify the image path of the primary container when you created the model hosted in this ``ProductionVariant`` , the path resolves to a path of the form ``registry/repository[@digest]`` . A digest is a hash value that identifies a specific version of an image. For information about Amazon ECR paths, see `Pulling an Image <http://docs.aws.amazon.com//AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-pull-ecr-image.html>`__ in the *Amazon ECR User Guide* .

        

        SpecifiedImage -> (string)

          

          The image path you specified when you created the model.

          

          

        ResolvedImage -> (string)

          

          The specific digest path of the image hosted in this ``ProductionVariant`` .

          

          

        ResolutionTime -> (timestamp)

          

          The date and time when the image path for the model resolved to the ``ResolvedImage``  

          

          

        

      

    CurrentWeight -> (float)

      

      The weight associated with the variant.

      

      

    DesiredWeight -> (float)

      

      The requested weight, as specified in the ``UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities`` request. 

      

      

    CurrentInstanceCount -> (integer)

      

      The number of instances associated with the variant.

      

      

    DesiredInstanceCount -> (integer)

      

      The number of instances requested in the ``UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities`` request. 

      

      

    

  

EndpointStatus -> (string)

  

  The status of the endpoint.

  

  

FailureReason -> (string)

  

  If the status of the endpoint is ``Failed`` , the reason why it failed. 

  

  

CreationTime -> (timestamp)

  

  A timestamp that shows when the endpoint was created.

  

  

LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)

  

  A timestamp that shows when the endpoint was last modified.
