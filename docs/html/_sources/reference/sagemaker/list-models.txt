Description
===========



Lists models created with the `CreateModel <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_CreateModel.html>`__ API.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/sagemaker-2017-07-24/ListModels>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``list-models`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Models``

=======
Options
=======

``--sort-by`` (string)


  Sorts the list of results. The default is ``CreationTime`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``Name``

  
  *   ``CreationTime``

  

  

``--sort-order`` (string)


  The sort order for results. The default is ``Ascending`` .

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``Ascending``

  
  *   ``Descending``

  

  

``--name-contains`` (string)


  A string in the training job name. This filter returns only models in the training job whose name contains the specified string.

  

``--creation-time-before`` (timestamp)


  A filter that returns only models created before the specified time (timestamp).

  

``--creation-time-after`` (timestamp)


  A filter that returns only models created after the specified time (timestamp).

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

Models -> (list)

  

  An array of ``ModelSummary`` objects, each of which lists a model.

  

  (structure)

    

    Provides summary information about a model.

    

    ModelName -> (string)

      

      The name of the model that you want a summary for.

      

      

    ModelArn -> (string)

      

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model.

      

      

    CreationTime -> (timestamp)

      

      A timestamp that indicates when the model was created.

      

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  If the response is truncated, Amazon SageMaker returns this token. To retrieve the next set of models, use it in the subsequent request.
