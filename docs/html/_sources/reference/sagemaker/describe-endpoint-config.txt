Returns the description of an endpoint configuration created using the ``CreateEndpointConfig`` API.

``--endpoint-config-name`` (string)


  The name of the endpoint configuration.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

======
Output
======

EndpointConfigName -> (string)

  

  Name of the Amazon SageMaker endpoint configuration.

  

  

EndpointConfigArn -> (string)

  

  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint configuration.

  

  

ProductionVariants -> (list)

  

  An array of ``ProductionVariant`` objects, one for each model that you want to host at this endpoint.

  

  (structure)

    

    Identifies a model that you want to host and the resources to deploy for hosting it. If you are deploying multiple models, tell Amazon SageMaker how to distribute traffic among the models by specifying variant weights. 

    

    VariantName -> (string)

      

      The name of the production variant.

      

      

    ModelName -> (string)

      

      The name of the model that you want to host. This is the name that you specified when creating the model.

      

      

    InitialInstanceCount -> (integer)

      

      Number of instances to launch initially.

      

      

    InstanceType -> (string)

      

      The ML compute instance type.

      

      

    InitialVariantWeight -> (float)

      

      Determines initial traffic distribution among all of the models that you specify in the endpoint configuration. The traffic to a production variant is determined by the ratio of the ``VariantWeight`` to the sum of all ``VariantWeight`` values across all ProductionVariants. If unspecified, it defaults to 1.0. 

      

      

    

  

KmsKeyId -> (string)

  

  AWS KMS key ID Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt data when storing it on the ML storage volume attached to the instance.

  

  

CreationTime -> (timestamp)

  

  A timestamp that shows when the endpoint configuration was created.
