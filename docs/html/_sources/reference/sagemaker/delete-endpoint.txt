===========
Description
===========



Deletes an endpoint. Amazon SageMaker frees up all of the resources that were deployed when the endpoint was created. 

 

Amazon SageMaker retires any custom KMS key grants associated with the endpoint, meaning you don't need to use the `RevokeGrant <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_RevokeGrant.html>`__ API call.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Options

``--endpoint-name`` (string)


  The name of the endpoint that you want to delete.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
