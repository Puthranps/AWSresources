=======
Options
=======

``--job-name`` (string)


  The name of the job definition to use.

  

``--job-run-id`` (string)


  The ID of a previous JobRun to retry.

  

``--arguments`` (map)


  The job arguments specifically for this run. They override the equivalent default arguments set for in the job definition itself.

   

  You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script consumes, as well as arguments that AWS Glue itself consumes.

   

  For information about how to specify and consume your own Job arguments, see the `Calling AWS Glue APIs in Python <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-python-calling.html>`__ topic in the developer guide.

   

  For information about the key-value pairs that AWS Glue consumes to set up your job, see the `Special Parameters Used by AWS Glue <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-glue-arguments.html>`__ topic in the developer guide.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string




JSON Syntax::

  {"string": "string"
    ...}



``--allocated-capacity`` (integer)


  The number of AWS Glue data processing units (DPUs) to allocate to this JobRun. From 2 to 100 DPUs can be allocated; the default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the `AWS Glue pricing page <https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/>`__ .

  

``--timeout`` (integer)


  The JobRun timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job run can consume resources before it is terminated and enters ``TIMEOUT`` status. The default is 2,880 minutes (48 hours). This overrides the timeout value set in the parent job.

  

``--notification-property`` (structure)


  Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    NotifyDelayAfter=integer




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "NotifyDelayAfter": integer
  }



``--security-configuration`` (string)


  The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used with this job run.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.
