=======
Options
=======

``--catalog-id`` (string)


  The ID of the Data Catalog where the partitions in question reside. If none is supplied, the AWS account ID is used by default.

  

``--database-name`` (string)


  The name of the catalog database where the partitions reside.

  

``--table-name`` (string)


  The name of the partitions' table.

  

``--partitions-to-get`` (list)


  A list of partition values identifying the partitions to retrieve.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Values=string,string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Values": ["string", ...]
    }
    ...
  ]



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
