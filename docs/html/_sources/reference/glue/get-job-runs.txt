===========
Description
===========



Retrieves metadata for all runs of a given job definition.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/glue-2017-03-31/GetJobRuns>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``get-job-runs`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``JobRuns``

Options

``--job-name`` (string)


  The name of the job definition for which to retrieve all job runs.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

      The ID of the previous run of this job. For example, the JobRunId specified in the StartJobRun action.

      

      

    TriggerName -> (string)

      

      The name of the trigger that started this job run.

      

      

    JobName -> (string)

      

      The name of the job definition being used in this run.

      

      

    StartedOn -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time at which this job run was started.

      

      

    LastModifiedOn -> (timestamp)

      

      The last time this job run was modified.

      

      

    CompletedOn -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time this job run completed.

      

      

    JobRunState -> (string)

      

      The current state of the job run.

      

      

    Arguments -> (map)

      

      The job arguments associated with this run. These override equivalent default arguments set for the job.

       

      You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script consumes, as well as arguments that AWS Glue itself consumes.

       

      For information about how to specify and consume your own job arguments, see the `Calling AWS Glue APIs in Python <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-python-calling.html>`__ topic in the developer guide.

       

      For information about the key-value pairs that AWS Glue consumes to set up your job, see the `Special Parameters Used by AWS Glue <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-glue-arguments.html>`__ topic in the developer guide.

      

      key -> (string)

      (structure)

        

        A job run that was used in the predicate of a conditional trigger that triggered this job run.

        

        JobName -> (string)

          

          The name of the job definition used by the predecessor job run.

          

          

        RunId -> (string)

          

          The job-run ID of the predecessor job run.

          

          

        

      

    AllocatedCapacity -> (integer)

      

      The number of AWS Glue data processing units (DPUs) allocated to this JobRun. From 2 to 100 DPUs can be allocated; the default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the `AWS Glue pricing page <https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/>`__ .

      

      

    ExecutionTime -> (integer)

      

      The amount of time (in seconds) that the job run consumed resources.

      

      

    Timeout -> (integer)

      

      The JobRun timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job run can consume resources before it is terminated and enters ``TIMEOUT`` status. The default is 2,880 minutes (48 hours). This overrides the timeout value set in the parent job.

      

      

    NotificationProperty -> (structure)

      

      Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification.

      

      NotifyDelayAfter -> (integer)

        

        After a job run starts, the number of minutes to wait before sending a job run delay notification.

    LogGroupName -> (string)

This name can be ``/aws-glue/jobs/`` , in which case the default encryption is ``NONE`` . If you add a role name and SecurityConfiguration name (in other words, ``/aws-glue/jobs-yourRoleName-yourSecurityConfigurationName/`` ), then that security configuration will be used to encrypt the log group.

      

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  A continuation token, if not all reequested job runs have been returned.
