===========
Description
===========



Retrieves all the DevEndpoints in this AWS account.

 

.. note::

   

  When you create a development endpoint in a virtual private cloud (VPC), AWS Glue returns only a private IP address and the public IP address field is not populated. When you create a non-VPC development endpoint, AWS Glue returns only a public IP address.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``get-dev-endpoints`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``DevEndpoints``

    get-dev-endpoints
  [--cli-input-json <value>]

  [--page-size <value>]
  [--max-items <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

      The subnet ID for this DevEndpoint.

      

      

    YarnEndpointAddress -> (string)

      

      The YARN endpoint address used by this DevEndpoint.

      

      

    PrivateAddress -> (string)

      

      A private IP address to access the DevEndpoint within a VPC, if the DevEndpoint is created within one. The PrivateAddress field is present only when you create the DevEndpoint within your virtual private cloud (VPC).

      

      

    ZeppelinRemoteSparkInterpreterPort -> (integer)

      

      The Apache Zeppelin port for the remote Apache Spark interpreter.

      

      

    PublicAddress -> (string)

      

      The public IP address used by this DevEndpoint. The PublicAddress field is present only when you create a non-VPC (virtual private cloud) DevEndpoint.

      

      

    Status -> (string)

      

      The current status of this DevEndpoint.

    ExtraPythonLibsS3Path -> (string)

      

      Path(s) to one or more Python libraries in an S3 bucket that should be loaded in your DevEndpoint. Multiple values must be complete paths separated by a comma.

       

      Please note that only pure Python libraries can currently be used on a DevEndpoint. Libraries that rely on C extensions, such as the `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ Python data analysis library, are not yet supported.

      

      

    ExtraJarsS3Path -> (string)

      

      Path to one or more Java Jars in an S3 bucket that should be loaded in your DevEndpoint.

    PublicKey -> (string)

      

      The public key to be used by this DevEndpoint for authentication. This attribute is provided for backward compatibility, as the recommended attribute to use is public keys.

      

      

    PublicKeys -> (list)

      

      A list of public keys to be used by the DevEndpoints for authentication. The use of this attribute is preferred over a single public key because the public keys allow you to have a different private key per client.

       

      .. note::

         

        If you previously created an endpoint with a public key, you must remove that key to be able to set a list of public keys: call the ``UpdateDevEndpoint`` API with the public key content in the ``deletePublicKeys`` attribute, and the list of new keys in the ``addPublicKeys`` attribute.

         

      

      (string)

  A continuation token, if not all DevEndpoint definitions have yet been returned.
