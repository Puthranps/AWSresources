=======
Options
=======

``--endpoint-name`` (string)


  The name to be assigned to the new DevEndpoint.

  

``--role-arn`` (string)


  The IAM role for the DevEndpoint.

  

``--security-group-ids`` (list)


  Security group IDs for the security groups to be used by the new DevEndpoint.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--subnet-id`` (string)


  The subnet ID for the new DevEndpoint to use.

  

``--public-key`` (string)


  The public key to be used by this DevEndpoint for authentication. This attribute is provided for backward compatibility, as the recommended attribute to use is public keys.

  

``--public-keys`` (list)


  A list of public keys to be used by the DevEndpoints for authentication. The use of this attribute is preferred over a single public key because the public keys allow you to have a different private key per client.

   

  .. note::

     

    If you previously created an endpoint with a public key, you must remove that key to be able to set a list of public keys: call the ``UpdateDevEndpoint`` API with the public key content in the ``deletePublicKeys`` attribute, and the list of new keys in the ``addPublicKeys`` attribute.

     

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--number-of-nodes`` (integer)


  The number of AWS Glue Data Processing Units (DPUs) to allocate to this DevEndpoint.

  

``--extra-python-libs-s3-path`` (string)


  Path(s) to one or more Python libraries in an S3 bucket that should be loaded in your DevEndpoint. Multiple values must be complete paths separated by a comma.

   

  Please note that only pure Python libraries can currently be used on a DevEndpoint. Libraries that rely on C extensions, such as the `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ Python data analysis library, are not yet supported.

  

``--extra-jars-s3-path`` (string)


  Path to one or more Java Jars in an S3 bucket that should be loaded in your DevEndpoint.

  

``--security-configuration`` (string)


  The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used with this DevEndpoint.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
