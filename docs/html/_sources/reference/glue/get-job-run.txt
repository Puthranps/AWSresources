Retrieves the metadata for a given job run.

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.

Synopsis

::

    get-job-run
  --job-name <value>
  --run-id <value>
  [--predecessors-included | --no-predecessors-included]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--job-name`` (string)


  Name of the job definition being run.

  

``--run-id`` (string)


  The ID of the job run.

  

``--predecessors-included`` | ``--no-predecessors-included`` (boolean)


  True if a list of predecessor runs should be returned.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.


See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


======
Output
======

JobRun -> (structure)

  

  The requested job-run metadata.

  

  Id -> (string)

    

    The ID of this job run.

    

    

  Attempt -> (integer)

    

    The number of the attempt to run this job.

    

    

  PreviousRunId -> (string)

    

    The ID of the previous run of this job. For example, the JobRunId specified in the StartJobRun action.

    

    

  TriggerName -> (string)

    

    The name of the trigger that started this job run.

    

    

  JobName -> (string)

    

    The name of the job definition being used in this run.

    

    

  StartedOn -> (timestamp)

    

    The date and time at which this job run was started.

    

    

  LastModifiedOn -> (timestamp)

    

    The last time this job run was modified.

    

    

  CompletedOn -> (timestamp)

    

    The date and time this job run completed.

    

    

  JobRunState -> (string)

    

    The current state of the job run.

    

    

  Arguments -> (map)

    

    The job arguments associated with this run. These override equivalent default arguments set for the job.

     

    You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script consumes, as well as arguments that AWS Glue itself consumes.

     

    For information about how to specify and consume your own job arguments, see the `Calling AWS Glue APIs in Python <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-python-calling.html>`__ topic in the developer guide.

     

    For information about the key-value pairs that AWS Glue consumes to set up your job, see the `Special Parameters Used by AWS Glue <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-glue-arguments.html>`__ topic in the developer guide.

    

    key -> (string)

      

      

    value -> (string)

      

      

    

  ErrorMessage -> (string)

    

    An error message associated with this job run.

    

    

  PredecessorRuns -> (list)

    

    A list of predecessors to this job run.

    

    (structure)

      

      A job run that was used in the predicate of a conditional trigger that triggered this job run.

      

      JobName -> (string)

        

        The name of the job definition used by the predecessor job run.

        

        

      RunId -> (string)

        

        The job-run ID of the predecessor job run.

        

        

      

    

  AllocatedCapacity -> (integer)

    

    The number of AWS Glue data processing units (DPUs) allocated to this JobRun. From 2 to 100 DPUs can be allocated; the default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the `AWS Glue pricing page <https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/>`__ .

    

    

  ExecutionTime -> (integer)

    

    The amount of time (in seconds) that the job run consumed resources.

    

    

  Timeout -> (integer)

    

    The JobRun timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job run can consume resources before it is terminated and enters ``TIMEOUT`` status. The default is 2,880 minutes (48 hours). This overrides the timeout value set in the parent job.

    

    

  NotificationProperty -> (structure)

    

    Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification.

    

    NotifyDelayAfter -> (integer)

      

      After a job run starts, the number of minutes to wait before sending a job run delay notification.

      

      

    

  SecurityConfiguration -> (string)

    

    The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used with this job run.

    

    

  LogGroupName -> (string)

    

    The name of the log group for secure logging, that can be server-side encrypted in CloudWatch using KMS. This name can be ``/aws-glue/jobs/`` , in which case the default encryption is ``NONE`` . If you add a role name and SecurityConfiguration name (in other words, ``/aws-glue/jobs-yourRoleName-yourSecurityConfigurationName/`` ), then that security configuration will be used to encrypt the log group.
