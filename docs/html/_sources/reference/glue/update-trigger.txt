``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output
======

Trigger -> (structure)

  

  The resulting trigger definition.

  

  Name -> (string)

    

    Name of the trigger.

    

    

  Id -> (string)

    

    Reserved for future use.

    

    

  Type -> (string)

    

    The type of trigger that this is.

    

    

  State -> (string)

    

    The current state of the trigger.

    

    

  Description -> (string)

    

    A description of this trigger.

    

    

  Schedule -> (string)

    

    A ``cron`` expression used to specify the schedule (see `Time-Based Schedules for Jobs and Crawlers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-data-warehouse-schedule.html>`__ . For example, to run something every day at 12:15 UTC, you would specify: ``cron(15 12 * * ? *)`` .

    

    

  Actions -> (list)

    

    The actions initiated by this trigger.

    

    (structure)

      

      Defines an action to be initiated by a trigger.

      

      JobName -> (string)

        

        The name of a job to be executed.

        

        

      Arguments -> (map)

        

        Arguments to be passed to the job run.

         

        You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script consumes, as well as arguments that AWS Glue itself consumes.

         

        For information about how to specify and consume your own Job arguments, see the `Calling AWS Glue APIs in Python <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-python-calling.html>`__ topic in the developer guide.

         

        For information about the key-value pairs that AWS Glue consumes to set up your job, see the `Special Parameters Used by AWS Glue <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-glue-arguments.html>`__ topic in the developer guide.

        

        key -> (string)

      Timeout -> (integer)

        

        The JobRun timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job run can consume resources before it is terminated and enters ``TIMEOUT`` status. The default is 2,880 minutes (48 hours). This overrides the timeout value set in the parent job.

        

        

      NotificationProperty -> (structure)

        

        Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification.

        The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used with this action.

        

        

      

    

  Predicate -> (structure)

    

    The predicate of this trigger, which defines when it will fire.

    

    Logical -> (string)

      

      Optional field if only one condition is listed. If multiple conditions are listed, then this field is required.

      

      

    Conditions -> (list)

      

      A list of the conditions that determine when the trigger will fire.

      

      (structure)

        

        Defines a condition under which a trigger fires.

        

        LogicalOperator -> (string)

          

          A logical operator.

          

          

        JobName -> (string)

          

          The name of the Job to whose JobRuns this condition applies and on which this trigger waits.

          

          

        State -> (string)

          

          The condition state. Currently, the values supported are SUCCEEDED, STOPPED, TIMEOUT and FAILED.
