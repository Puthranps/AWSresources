::

    get-classifier
  --name <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--name`` (string)


  Name of the classifier to retrieve.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output
======

Classifier -> (structure)

  

  The requested classifier.

  

  GrokClassifier -> (structure)

    

    A ``GrokClassifier`` object.

    

    Name -> (string)

      

      The name of the classifier.

      

      

    Classification -> (string)

      

      An identifier of the data format that the classifier matches, such as Twitter, JSON, Omniture logs, and so on.

      

      

    CreationTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The time this classifier was registered.

      

      

    LastUpdated -> (timestamp)

      

      The time this classifier was last updated.

      

      

    Version -> (long)

      

      The version of this classifier.

      

      

    GrokPattern -> (string)

      

      The grok pattern applied to a data store by this classifier. For more information, see built-in patterns in `Writing Custom Classifers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/custom-classifier.html>`__ .

      

      

    CustomPatterns -> (string)

      

      Optional custom grok patterns defined by this classifier. For more information, see custom patterns in `Writing Custom Classifers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/custom-classifier.html>`__ .

      

      

    

  XMLClassifier -> (structure)

    

    An ``XMLClassifier`` object.

    

    Name -> (string)

      

      The name of the classifier.

      

      

    Classification -> (string)

      

      An identifier of the data format that the classifier matches.

      

      

    CreationTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The time this classifier was registered.

      

      

    LastUpdated -> (timestamp)

      

      The time this classifier was last updated.

      

      

    Version -> (long)

      

      The version of this classifier.

      

      

    RowTag -> (string)

      

      The XML tag designating the element that contains each record in an XML document being parsed. Note that this cannot identify a self-closing element (closed by ``/>`` ). An empty row element that contains only attributes can be parsed as long as it ends with a closing tag (for example, ``<row item_a="A" item_b="B"></row>`` is okay, but ``<row item_a="A" item_b="B" />`` is not).

      

      

    

  JsonClassifier -> (structure)

    

    A ``JsonClassifier`` object.

    

    Name -> (string)

      

      The name of the classifier.

      

      

    CreationTime -> (timestamp)

      

      The time this classifier was registered.

      

      

    LastUpdated -> (timestamp)

      

      The time this classifier was last updated.

      

      

    Version -> (long)

      

      The version of this classifier.

      

      

    JsonPath -> (string)

      

      A ``JsonPath`` string defining the JSON data for the classifier to classify. AWS Glue supports a subset of JsonPath, as described in `Writing JsonPath Custom Classifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/custom-classifier.html#custom-classifier-json>`__ .
