************
delete-table

===========
Description
===========



Removes a table definition from the Data Catalog.

 

.. note::

   

  After completing this operation, you will no longer have access to the table versions and partitions that belong to the deleted table. AWS Glue deletes these "orphaned" resources asynchronously in a timely manner, at the discretion of the service.

   

  To ensure immediate deletion of all related resources, before calling ``DeleteTable`` , use ``DeleteTableVersion`` or ``BatchDeleteTableVersion`` , and ``DeletePartition`` or ``BatchDeletePartition`` , to delete any resources that belong to the table.

=======
Options
=======

``--catalog-id`` (string)


  The ID of the Data Catalog where the table resides. If none is supplied, the AWS account ID is used by default.

  

``--database-name`` (string)


  The name of the catalog database in which the table resides. For Hive compatibility, this name is entirely lowercase.

  

``--name`` (string)


  The name of the table to be deleted. For Hive compatibility, this name is entirely lowercase.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
