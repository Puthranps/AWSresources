Lists all classifier objects in the Data Catalog.

``get-classifiers`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Classifiers``

    get-classifiers
  [--cli-input-json <value>]

  [--max-items <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output
======

Classifiers -> (list)

  

  The requested list of classifier objects.

  

  (structure)

    

    Classifiers are triggered during a crawl task. A classifier checks whether a given file is in a format it can handle, and if it is, the classifier creates a schema in the form of a ``StructType`` object that matches that data format.

     

    You can use the standard classifiers that AWS Glue supplies, or you can write your own classifiers to best categorize your data sources and specify the appropriate schemas to use for them. A classifier can be a ``grok`` classifier, an ``XML`` classifier, or a ``JSON`` classifier, as specified in one of the fields in the ``Classifier`` object.

    

    GrokClassifier -> (structure)

      

      A ``GrokClassifier`` object.

      

      Name -> (string)

        

        The name of the classifier.

        

        

      Classification -> (string)

        

        An identifier of the data format that the classifier matches, such as Twitter, JSON, Omniture logs, and so on.

        

        

      CreationTime -> (timestamp)

        

        The time this classifier was registered.

        

        

      LastUpdated -> (timestamp)

        

        The time this classifier was last updated.

        

        

      Version -> (long)

        

        The version of this classifier.

        

        

      GrokPattern -> (string)

        

        The grok pattern applied to a data store by this classifier. For more information, see built-in patterns in `Writing Custom Classifers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/custom-classifier.html>`__ .

        

        

      CustomPatterns -> (string)

        

        Optional custom grok patterns defined by this classifier. For more information, see custom patterns in `Writing Custom Classifers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/custom-classifier.html>`__ .

        

        

      

    XMLClassifier -> (structure)

      

      An ``XMLClassifier`` object.

      

      Name -> (string)

        

        The name of the classifier.

        

        

      Classification -> (string)

        

        An identifier of the data format that the classifier matches.

        

        

      CreationTime -> (timestamp)

        

        The time this classifier was registered.

        

        

      LastUpdated -> (timestamp)

        

        The time this classifier was last updated.

        

        

      Version -> (long)

        

        The version of this classifier.

        

        

      RowTag -> (string)

        

        The XML tag designating the element that contains each record in an XML document being parsed. Note that this cannot identify a self-closing element (closed by ``/>`` ). An empty row element that contains only attributes can be parsed as long as it ends with a closing tag (for example, ``<row item_a="A" item_b="B"></row>`` is okay, but ``<row item_a="A" item_b="B" />`` is not).

        

        

      

    JsonClassifier -> (structure)

      

      A ``JsonClassifier`` object.

      

      Name -> (string)

        

        The name of the classifier.

        

        

      CreationTime -> (timestamp)

        

        The time this classifier was registered.

        

        

      LastUpdated -> (timestamp)

        

        The time this classifier was last updated.

        

        

      Version -> (long)

        

        The version of this classifier.

        

        

      JsonPath -> (string)

        

        A ``JsonPath`` string defining the JSON data for the classifier to classify. AWS Glue supports a subset of JsonPath, as described in `Writing JsonPath Custom Classifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/custom-classifier.html#custom-classifier-json>`__ .

        

        

      

    

  

NextToken -> (string)

  

  A continuation token.
