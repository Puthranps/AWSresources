===========
Description
===========



Retrieves information about a specified DevEndpoint.

 

.. note::

   

  When you create a development endpoint in a virtual private cloud (VPC), AWS Glue returns only a private IP address, and the public IP address field is not populated. When you create a non-VPC development endpoint, AWS Glue returns only a public IP address.

Options

``--endpoint-name`` (string)


  Name of the DevEndpoint for which to retrieve information.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

Output
======

DevEndpoint -> (structure)

  

  A DevEndpoint definition.

  

  EndpointName -> (string)

    

    The name of the DevEndpoint.

    

    

  RoleArn -> (string)

    

    The AWS ARN of the IAM role used in this DevEndpoint.

    

    

  SecurityGroupIds -> (list)

    

    A list of security group identifiers used in this DevEndpoint.

    

    (string)

      

      

    

  SubnetId -> (string)

    

    The subnet ID for this DevEndpoint.

    

    

  YarnEndpointAddress -> (string)

    

    The YARN endpoint address used by this DevEndpoint.

    

    

  PrivateAddress -> (string)

    

    A private IP address to access the DevEndpoint within a VPC, if the DevEndpoint is created within one. The PrivateAddress field is present only when you create the DevEndpoint within your virtual private cloud (VPC).

    

    

  ZeppelinRemoteSparkInterpreterPort -> (integer)

    

    The Apache Zeppelin port for the remote Apache Spark interpreter.

    

    

  PublicAddress -> (string)

    

    The public IP address used by this DevEndpoint. The PublicAddress field is present only when you create a non-VPC (virtual private cloud) DevEndpoint.

    

    

  Status -> (string)

    

    The current status of this DevEndpoint.

    

    

  NumberOfNodes -> (integer)

    

    The number of AWS Glue Data Processing Units (DPUs) allocated to this DevEndpoint.

    

    

  AvailabilityZone -> (string)

    

    The AWS availability zone where this DevEndpoint is located.

    

    

  VpcId -> (string)

    

    The ID of the virtual private cloud (VPC) used by this DevEndpoint.

    

    

  ExtraPythonLibsS3Path -> (string)

    

    Path(s) to one or more Python libraries in an S3 bucket that should be loaded in your DevEndpoint. Multiple values must be complete paths separated by a comma.

     

    Please note that only pure Python libraries can currently be used on a DevEndpoint. Libraries that rely on C extensions, such as the `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ Python data analysis library, are not yet supported.

    

    

  ExtraJarsS3Path -> (string)

    

    Path to one or more Java Jars in an S3 bucket that should be loaded in your DevEndpoint.

     

    Please note that only pure Java/Scala libraries can currently be used on a DevEndpoint.

    

    

  FailureReason -> (string)

    

    The reason for a current failure in this DevEndpoint.

    

    

  LastUpdateStatus -> (string)

    

    The status of the last update.

    

    

  CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)

    

    The point in time at which this DevEndpoint was created.

    

    

  LastModifiedTimestamp -> (timestamp)

    

    The point in time at which this DevEndpoint was last modified.

    

    

  PublicKey -> (string)

    

    The public key to be used by this DevEndpoint for authentication. This attribute is provided for backward compatibility, as the recommended attribute to use is public keys.

    

    

  PublicKeys -> (list)

    

    A list of public keys to be used by the DevEndpoints for authentication. The use of this attribute is preferred over a single public key because the public keys allow you to have a different private key per client.

     

    .. note::

       

      If you previously created an endpoint with a public key, you must remove that key to be able to set a list of public keys: call the ``UpdateDevEndpoint`` API with the public key content in the ``deletePublicKeys`` attribute, and the list of new keys in the ``addPublicKeys`` attribute.

       

    

    (string)

      

      

    

  SecurityConfiguration -> (string)

    

    The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used with this DevEndpoint.
