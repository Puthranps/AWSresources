===========
Description
===========



Retrieves information about the partitions in a table.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/glue-2017-03-31/GetPartitions>`_

See :doc:`'aws help' </reference/index>` for descriptions of global parameters.


``get-partitions`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Partitions``

  --table-name <value>
  [--expression <value>]
  [--segment <value>]

  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--catalog-id`` (string)


  The ID of the Data Catalog where the partitions in question reside. If none is supplied, the AWS account ID is used by default.

  

``--database-name`` (string)


  The name of the catalog database where the partitions reside.

  

``--table-name`` (string)


  The name of the partitions' table.

  

``--expression`` (string)


  An expression filtering the partitions to be returned.

   

  The expression uses SQL syntax similar to the SQL ``WHERE`` filter clause. The SQL statement parser `JSQLParser <http://jsqlparser.sourceforge.net/home.php>`__ parses the expression. 

   

   *Operators* : The following are the operators that you can use in the ``Expression`` API call:

    =  

  Checks if the values of the two operands are equal or not; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

   

  Example: Assume 'variable a' holds 10 and 'variable b' holds 20. 

   

  (a = b) is not true.

    < >  

  Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not; if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.

   

  Example: (a < > b) is true.

    >  

  Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

   

  Example: (a > b) is not true.

    <  

  Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

   

  Example: (a < b) is true.

    >=  

  Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

   

  Example: (a >= b) is not true.

    <=  

  Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

   

  Example: (a <= b) is true.

    AND, OR, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, NOT, IS NULL  

  Logical operators.

     

   *Supported Partition Key Types* : The following are the the supported partition keys.

   

   
  * ``string``   
   
  * ``date``   
   
  * ``timestamp``   
   
  * ``int``   
   
  * ``bigint``   
   
  * ``long``   
   
  * ``tinyint``   
   
  * ``smallint``   
   
  * ``decimal``   
   

   

  If an invalid type is encountered, an exception is thrown. 

   

  The following list shows the valid operators on each type. When you define a crawler, the ``partitionKey`` type is created as a ``STRING`` , to be compatible with the catalog partitions. 

   

   *Sample API Call* : 

  

``--segment`` (structure)


  The segment of the table's partitions to scan in this request.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    SegmentNumber=integer,TotalSegments=integer




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "SegmentNumber": integer,
    "TotalSegments": integer
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`__ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
