Description

Uploads an image layer part to Amazon ECR.

 

.. note::

=======
Options
=======

``--registry-id`` (string)


  The AWS account ID associated with the registry to which you are uploading layer parts. If you do not specify a registry, the default registry is assumed.

  

``--repository-name`` (string)


  The name of the repository to which you are uploading layer parts.

  

``--upload-id`` (string)


  The upload ID from a previous  InitiateLayerUpload operation to associate with the layer part upload.

  

``--part-first-byte`` (long)


  The integer value of the first byte of the layer part.

  

``--part-last-byte`` (long)


  The integer value of the last byte of the layer part.

  

``--layer-part-blob`` (blob)


  The base64-encoded layer part payload.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
