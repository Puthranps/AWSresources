AWS CLI support for this service is only available in a preview stage.

However, if you'd like to use the "aws sdb" commands with the
AWS CLI, you can enable this service by adding the following to your CLI
config file:

    [preview]
    sdb=true

or by running:

    aws configure set preview.sdb true
